Hopefully doing the right thing by these gentle beings would be enough to motivate them to replace just one of the hundreds or thousands of possible ingredients in their diet.",

Plant biology is many and varied, there is more to be said here, but it would probably lost on anyone silly enough to ask this question.",
      "Ignoring them, there is a serious point for us to think about here.  In evolutionary terms there aren't distinct, easily identifiable separate kingdoms of plants and animals, it is all very much a continuum.  We need to ask ourselves where we draw the line and on what basis we do so.",
      "Darwin and the best biologists since have understood that our common evolutionary heritage expresses itself in us sharing our sentience with other beings.

Anyone who reads up on the science in this respect would know that the jury is still out, and thus rash claims are unwarranted.",
      "Forward facing eyes is a strange one but it comes up.  We have two separate eyes to enable depth perception just like most animals.  The theory is that for prey species they are wider apart, giving them better peripheral vision to see attackers.  So far so good, where it gets muddled is in people thinking that if you don't have eyes on the sides of your head, that makes you a carnivore.  I was going to list animals which have forward facing eyes and are herbivores or omnivores, or ones which have eyes on the sides of their heads and are carnivores, but I figure you can do that yourself.  Once you've done that for about five seconds you'll understand that eye placement is no clear evolutionary sign of any single thing.",

A vegan going to a restaurant or friends house can simply avoid animal products, whereas the compassionate carnivore has to go into almost historical detail about the products used, or eat vegan anyway if the choices available turn out to be from factory farms.  They are also going to be out of pocket, as much of the cruelty involved in the system is to keep costs down.  Vegans can turn to cheap legumes and beans, but people who want to eat more compassionately whilst continuing to eat animals multiple times a day are going to be spending a lot more of their income on food.",

      "Take a burger, is that really an animal food?  People are overly focused on the animal products in a meal when they are often just a portion of the total calories.  In your average fast food hamburger, the patty itself often has grains, flavours, herbs, spices, onions and flour or breadcrumbs added to it.  It is then encased in tomato, lettuce, pickle, onions (beetroot in Australia!) and bread, smothered in sauces.  Often the meat is less than a fifth of the end product which doesn't in anyway resemble, or even taste like the animal that small part came from.  If a vegan replaces that with some other form of protein, we end up with a pretty similar product.",
      "When it comes to what we replace animal protein with, we have a wide array, not just tofu.  Nuts, seeds, grains, vegetables, legumes, yes and soy such as tempeh and tofu all have protein which we can use to make chewy textures in our food.  Plant based foods are getting better and more varied all the time as veganism grows, so we should encourage non vegans to give them a try as a convenient way to have a familiar, but meat free meal.",
      "Ultimately people who ask this are missing the point.  It is oppression and violence that we oppose, not a particular ingredient's texture, shape or flavour. Many vegans avoid products resembling animal foods because they have uncomfortable connotations for them, and that is their right.  Others are happy eating anything so long as they aren't contributing to factory farming, and that is their right.  Both are ethical choices.  People eating animals should focus on the ethics of what they eat, as opposed to the aesthetics of what vegans eat."

Massive outbreaks of deadly disease used to be common; to intervene with medicine is not purely natural, but surely it would be immoral to do anything else.  Cannibalism, slavery, warfare, all sort of atrocities have long and common histories amongst people, so are they natural and if so is that some valid ethical defense of them?",

Many people also use the process of becoming vegan to transition to a healthier diet, by following all that nutritional advice of \"Eat more fruits and vegetables\".",

Take a B12 supplement and you are done.

Pretty much the only expensive vegan ingredients that differ to the modern western diet are the meat and cheese analogues.
