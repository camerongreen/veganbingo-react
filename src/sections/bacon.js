const short_answer = `<p>Sometimes a joke, especially one that people laugh at for ideological reasons, tells us something about the character of person telling it or laughing at it, and usually it isn't good. Mobs throughout history have laughed whilst inflicting unjust suffering. One of the most important things we have to do in life is not be a member of those mobs.</p>`;

<p>There are some good jokes that make light of veganism, like any joke the best of them are clever, unique and unexpected. This attempt at a joke has none of these qualities. It is repeatedly said, well beyond anyone's tolerance for boredom, generally with a pretense that the person saying it just thought of it themselves. It is highly unlikely, however, that anyone repeating \\"Mmmm Bacon\\" has ever added an original thought to the culture. The reason it doesn't seem to get less funny with repetition, is partly because it was never funny in the first place. 99% of the people who say it ere immature males, along with 100% of those who laugh at it, make of that what you will.</p>
<p>Of course laughter is complex, people often laugh at things not because they are funny but because they want to laugh for performative reasons. It often even sounds fake, a jarring echo from a hollow soul, like someone read in a book what a laugh was and is trying it out. Laughing at the misfortunes of others is correlated with psychopathy and other destructive and self-destructive personality traits. We can argue about what things are OK to joke about, and I personally like a bit of schadenfreude, but jokes that have victims need to held to a higher standard. Humour, even dark humour, should make the world a better place. Empty grasping for attention by people being offensive because they are not interesting enough to be funny is not doing anything for the world.</p>
<p>In psychological terms there is something called a cold joke. It's been witnessed in atrocities towards humans for centuries. Those perpetrating immoral acts use fake humour to try to avoid the psychological ramifications of something disturbing they are participating in. They bond with other damaged souls, with the same insincerity and toxic emotion that will probably define all of the relationships in their lives. If billions of creatures living, suffering and dying in factory farms and slaughterhouses means nothing to a person, we might ponder how capable they are of true connection with any other consciousnesses. We must pity them because connection is one of life's greatest gifts.</p>
<p>Pigs, cows, chickens etc, we see something of ourselves when we look into their eyes. These are thinking, feeling beings we share evolutionary kinship with, who seek to be happy much as we do. More animals suffer and die in our industrial prison system every week then all humans who have been killed in wars during our bloody history. We need to do something more about this reality than psychological avoidance, whether through the fake humour of toxic masculinity or just the turning away of most other people.</p>
<p>For most of history, people lived closely with wild animals. They knew that they had family and relationships of their own, they knew they were intelligent, they respected them, even if they needed to kill them to survive. Those who, from hundreds of miles away, pay for this terrible industry run for profit, with hands are stained by the blood of it, should at least start by encouraging others to show animals respect. Those animals in lightless sheds, in cages, lined up for their turn in a slaughterhouses, they are not nothing. These lives and deaths we don't see, that according to our whims can be terrible or bearable, imprisoned or free, these lives mean something</p>
<p>We can start making the world better for the life in it by changing our relationship to animals, especially farmed animals. Or you know, people could say something cruel and offensive and pretend it's a joke. I guess people have that choice, but it is such a small, barren, ugly choice, in a world full of so many expansive, challenging, beautiful possibilities, with so many kinder and greater deeds to be done. If it wasn't for my thoughts of the victims, I might even just laugh at these people.</p>
