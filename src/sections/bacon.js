const short_answer = `<p>Telling something that is presented as a joke but isn’t actually funny often reveals a lot about the character of the person involved, and usually it isn't good. Laughter is complex, it’s like many tools that can be used for good or bad. It can be innocent and sincere but can also be forced and fake, used as part of a status hierarchy or to declare our identity with a mob. If someone is faking laughter or pretending something is funny there’s not much you can do other than be glad it’s not you displaying your ethical and intellectual shallowness for all to see.</p>`;

<p>There are some good jokes that make light of veganism, like any joke the best of them can be clever, unique and unexpected. Then there are attempts at jokes that have none of these qualities. Such an attempt is “Bacon”, “Steak”, etc, repeatedly said beyond anyone's tolerance for boredom, generally with a pretence that the person saying it just thought of it themselves. It is highly unlikely, however, that anyone repeating "Bacon" has ever added an original thought to the culture. Few jokes, if we can call these statements that, get any funnier with repetition just as all mindless statements don’t get any more intelligent with repetition. 99% of the people who say such things seem to be immature males, along with 100% of those who pretend to laugh at them, make of that what you will.</p>


<p>Laughter is complex, science is struggling to understand all the reasons people and other animals laugh. It is clear though that people often laugh at things not because they are spontaneously funny but because they want to laugh for performative reasons. It often even sounds fake to the ear, like a jarring echo from a hollow place, like someone read in a book what a laugh was and is trying and failing to capture the essence of it. Laughing at the misfortunes of others is correlated with psychopathy and other destructive and self-destructive personality traits. We can argue about what things are OK to joke about, and I personally enjoy a dash of schadenfreude in my humour, but jokes that have victims need to be held to a higher standard. Humour, even dark humour, can make the world a better place, the rich, deep humour of Holocaust survivors is evidence of this. Sometimes it is life affirming to laugh when we don’t think we should, to take all of the world’s ugliness and find something to smile about in it. When humour, or the pretence of it, is used to bolster oppression and cruelty we see something else though, the ugly face of the mob, the angry, irrational part of us that drowns out the quiet voice of the intellect, of introspection, doubt and intellectual progress. Sartre famously said hell is other people, but hell is not all other people, it is some other people, in a large part these sort of people.</p>


<p>In psychological terms there is something called a cold joke. It's been witnessed in atrocities towards humans for centuries. Those perpetrating immoral acts use the pretence of humour to avoid the psychological ramifications of something disturbing they are participating in. They bond using leers and fake laughter with other damaged souls, exhibiting the same insincerity and toxic emotion that probably defines all of the relationships in their lives. If billions of creatures suffering and dying in factory farms and slaughterhouses mean nothing to a person, we might ponder if they are capable of empathetic connection with any other consciousnesses. We might even pity their selfishness and shallowness, because connection with others on a deep level is one of life's greatest gifts.</p>


<p>Pigs, cows, chickens, we see something of ourselves when we look into the eyes of any highly sentient creature. These are thinking, and feeling beings we share evolutionary kinship with, who seek to be happy as we do. More animals suffer and die in our industrial prison system every week than all the humans who have been killed in wars during our bloody history. We need to do something more about this reality than psychological avoidance, whether through the fake humour of toxic masculinity or just the turning away of most other people.</p>


<p>For most of history, people lived closely with wild animals. They knew that they had family and relationships of their own, they knew they were intelligent, and they respected them, even if they needed to kill them to survive. Those who pay for this terrible industry that they never personally witness the worst of, their hands indelibly stained by the blood of it, should at least start by showing the lives of these animals some respect. Those animals in lightless sheds, in cages, taken from their families, lined up for their turn in slaughterhouses, they are not nothing. These lives and deaths we don't see, that according to our whims can be terrible or bearable, imprisoned or free, these individuals each mean something, every moment of sentient experience in our universe means something.</p>


<p>We can start making the world better for the life in it by changing our personal relationship with animals, especially taking farmed animals from our plates. The alternative is staying in the mob, playing a part in oppression, perhaps by saying something cruel and offensive and pretending it's funny, or maybe just saying nothing and giving tacit support. People have that choice, but it is such a small, barren, life diminishing choice, in a world full of expansive, beautiful possibilities for life. With so many kind and great deeds to be done, things that challenge us to our highest collective flourishing, it seems sad that some people are trapped in prisons of their own habitual mediocrity, peering out angrily at the world, fearing change and growth, hating anybody who reminds them we can be kinder and better people. We might even just laugh at these people, if it wasn't for the fact they have so many victims.</p>
