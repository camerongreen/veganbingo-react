const short_answer = `<p>Jokes which rely on being cruel rather than being clever or unexpected reveal something about the character of people who laugh at them. Laughter is a complex human expression, sometimes we can’t help laughing but at other times it is very deliberate. Laughter can be innocent or sincere, forced or fake, it can be used as part of status displays or to declare our identity with a mob. If someone is using laughter to score a point, it’s probably a weak point but there’s not much you can do to enlighten them. Just avoid such people and be glad it’s not you wallowing in ethical and intellectual shallowness in service of cruelty.</p>`;

<p>There are some good jokes that make light of veganism, like any joke the best of them can be clever, unique and unexpected. Then there are attempts at jokes that have none of these qualities. People saying things like “I like bacon”, “I like steak”, etc, repeatedly beyond anyone's tolerance for boredom, generally have a pretence that they just thought of it themselves. It is highly unlikely, however, that anyone repeating "I like bacon" has added many original thoughts to the culture. Few jokes, which for convenience we will call these boorish statements, get funnier with repetition, just as all stupid statements don’t get more intelligent with repetition. Perhaps revealingly, 99% of the people who say or laugh at such things seem to be immature males.</p>


<p>Laughter is complex, science is struggling to understand all the reasons people and other animals laugh. It is clear though that people often laugh at things not because they are spontaneously funny but because they want to laugh for performative social reasons. It often even sounds fake to the ear, like an unkind jarring echo from a hollow place, like someone read in a book what a laugh was and is trying and failing to capture the essence of it. Laughing at the misfortunes of others is correlated with psychopathy and other destructive and self-destructive personality traits. We can argue about what things are OK to joke about, and I personally enjoy a dash of schadenfreude in my humour, but jokes that uphold evil in the world, that have victims, need to be held to a higher standard. Humour, even dark humour, can make light of dark places, the rich, deep humour of Holocaust survivors is evidence of this. Sometimes it is life-affirming to laugh when we don’t think we should, to take all of the world’s ugliness and find something to smile about in it. When humour, or the pretence of it, is used to bolster oppression and cruelty we see something else though, the ugly face of the mob, the angry, irrational part of us that drowns out the quiet voice of the intellect, of introspection, subtlety and intellectual progress. Sartre famously said hell is other people, but hell is not all other people, it is some other people, in a large part the sorts of people who laugh unkindly.</p>


<p>In psychological terms there is something called a cold joke. It's been witnessed in atrocities towards humans for centuries. Those perpetrating immoral acts, mass killings, torture and the like, use the pretence of humour to avoid the other psychological ramifications of something disturbing they are participating in. They bond using leers and fake laughter with other damaged souls, exhibiting the same insincerity and toxic emotion that probably defines most of the relationships in their lives. If someone can laugh about billions of creatures suffering in factory farms and dying in slaughterhouses and if they see someone caring about those lives as weakness, we might ponder if that person is capable of real empathetic connection with any other consciousnesses. We might even pity their selfishness and shallowness because emotional connection, the ability to empathise and care for others, to be vulnerable, to trust others at a deep level, is one of life's greatest blessings.</p>


<p>Pigs, cows, chickens, we should recognise something of ourselves when we look into the eyes of any highly sentient creature. These are thinking, and feeling beings we share our evolutionary kinship with, who seek to be happy as we do, and we can see that when we look in their eyes. More animals suffer and die in our industrial prison systems every week than all the humans who have been killed in wars during our bloody history. In modern times we outsourced our killing to others, butchers and slaughterhouse workers, and pushed the sight, sound and stench of killing on the outskirts of cities. In the ever increasing push for profits a system of animal confinement has been created which is intolerably cruel. For most of history, people lived closely with wild animals. They knew that they had family and relationships of their own, they knew they were intelligent, and they respected them, even if they needed to kill them to survive. That respect has been replaced by the morality of out of sight out of mind. Those who pay for this terrible industry that they never personally witness, their hands indelibly stained by blood they don’t wish to see, should start on repairing their relationship with the non-human world by showing the lives of animals respect. The animals in lightless sheds, in cages, taken from their families, and lined up for their turn in slaughterhouses, are not simply a mass product, they are individuals, someone with their own life story, personality and purposes. These lives and deaths which we wield a god-like power over, that according to our choices and whims can be either terrible or bearable, imprisoned or free, these lives are meaningful in themselves and as part of their communities. Motherhood, love, friendship, society, part of the reason we so easily rob other creatures of these experiences is that many myopically think of them as uniquely human, but they run much deeper than that.</p>


<p>If humans actually had to eat animals, if there was nothing else we could survive and thrive on, then ethics would still demand a radical overhaul of our farming system. The fact is though that we are omnivores and eating animals is a choice. We can make the world a better place by removing animals from our plates. The alternative is playing a part in oppression, perhaps trying to feel better about it by saying something cruel and offensive and pretending it's funny, or maybe just saying nothing and giving tacit support. Maybe one day keeping animals in factory farms will be illegal but currently people have the choice, but to treat other life in this way is a barren, life-diminishing choice, in a world full of expansive, beautiful possibilities for our relationship for other life. With so many kind and great deeds needing to be done in the world, things that can challenge us to embody our highest collective flourishing, it is sad that so many people are trapped in prisons of their own habitual mediocrity. Many people peer out suspiciously at the world, fearing change and growth, hating anybody who dares remind them that they can be kinder and better people. The greatest potential a person can fulfil is their ethical potential, and with respect to animals some people have a long way to go. We might even just laugh at these people if it wasn't for the reality of the victims.</p>


<p>Finally, a joke about carnists: “How many meat eaters does it take to change a lightbulb? None, they prefer to stay in the dark.”.</p>
