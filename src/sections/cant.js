const short_answer = `rom the perspective of an animal-product heavy diet, veganism may seem like self-denial; that vegans can’t eat many things that people consider the centre of their diet. Vegans see aligning our consumption with our ideals as the opposite of self-denial. Veganism is connecting with our compassion, of engaging with a world beyond social circles and status. Abstaining from a handful of ingredients is of little importance compared to restoring our relationship with the non-human world.`;

<p>It is interesting that people usually frame our avoidance of animal products with the word "can't". It sounds as if it is not a voluntary choice, but more like an allergy or a religious duty. It’s only a word of course, probably used with little thought, bit it grates a little to the ear. Veganism is very much active, about ongoing thoughtful choices rather than about purity or blind adherence to a set of rules.</p>
<p>Some people fully embrace this way of thinking, that compassion is not a personal stance or label, but it is about the tangible effects we are having in the world. These people call themselves freegans. Freegans will only personally buy vegan products but will eat animal products that would otherwise go to waste, such as those thrown away by businesses because they reach an arbitrary “best before” date etc. Environmentally and ethically freegans see little good in throwing away something that already exists in the world when all the misery and resource expenditure has been done. Many vegans are profoundly in agreement with this ethically, but the idea of eating an animal product feels similar to them that perhaps eating a human product might feel to others; it’s unnecessary and provokes a disgust response.</p>
<p>Then there are ostro-vegans. These are people who consider only sentience - the level of conscious awareness and ability to experience things like pleasure and pain that an individual has - in their consideration of what can be ethically consumed. The terms plant and animal seem very clear in our minds, but as is consistent with the evolutionary reality that animals evolved from plants, there are a wide range of creatures at almost every level of sentience. Ostro-vegans delve into this blurry line between plants and animals. Do creatures that can’t move and don’t appear to have any of the internal wiring needed for consciousness such as clams and mussels require the same moral consideration as clearly sentient beings such as pigs, chickens, cows and tuna? It is an interesting discussion, and again many vegans are sympathetic to this logic, even if it is somewhat irrelevant to them because they are happily following a purely vegan diet and don’t feel like they lack anything.</p>
<p>There is a semi-official definition of veganism given by the original Vegan Society based in England:</p>
<blockquote>"Veganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude—as far as is possible and practicable—all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of animals, humans and the environment. In dietary terms, it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals."</blockquote>
<p>Officially the Vegan Society doesn’t currently consider honey vegan, however, this wasn’t always the case and they have actually gone back and forth on this at least once over their history. It’s possible more humane techniques of farming bees in the future might change this again, or technology might give us the ability to make cheaper, biologically indistinguishable honey by other means. Veganism should not make the same mistake that some religions have, of fixing their morality at a point of time that becomes ever less relevant as the world around them changes.</p>
<p>Cultured meat, precision fermentation and pretty convincing “mock meats”, all make the idea of what is and is not an animal product more nuanced. As corporations that profit from factory farming diversify into the growing vegan market as well, it complicates things further. People not immersed in the ethical considerations around veganism often speak quite clumsily about it, "can" and "can’t", but there are few sharp lines in ethics.</p>
<p>Veganism should be about making the world better, not moral purity. There are some occasions where eating an animal product will probably have little effect on the life of an animal somewhere. Especially if we accidentally eat something, it is not really that ethically relevant, what we do 99.9% of the time is what matters. But as much as veganism should be practical, it is also a personal statement about where you stand in the ideological world. There is much to be said for displaying ethical consistency, for not appearing hypocritical, of seeming to ask of others things you don’t always do yourself. Whatever label you present to others, freegan, ostro vegan, vegan, or some other, whether you ask for it or not you are now a representative of that idea in the world. Whilst it is good to make clear what we aspire to ethically, we should also be clear to express our limitations, flaws and weaknesses, and no doubt this will create much more empathy with and connection to others as we try to communicate our message.</p>
<p>Finally, the second point is about people thinking vegans can't eat things that are usually vegan but not labelled as such. I’ve had bread, pasta, avocado and peanut butter...I guess it does have butter in the name. This partly shows how little people are engaged in their diet, they just accept what they are served up, what their parents served up and don’t really know what is in the foods they eat much less their repercussions on the world. If someone is open to discussion, it is a good chance to open their mind, especially to the fact that the basis of most people’s diets is already mostly vegan. This is especially true if they are eating healthily. However, to some people it is an opportunity to argue, and to the waitress who served us in West End all those years ago, you may work at an Italian restaurant and think you are an authority on the matter but pasta can definitely be, and dried pasta usually is, vegan.</p>
