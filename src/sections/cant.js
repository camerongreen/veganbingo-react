const short_answer = `<p>From the perspective of an animal-product heavy diet, veganism may seem restrictive; that vegans “can’t” eat many things that people consider the centre of their meals. Vegans however see aligning our consumption with our compassion as the opposite of self-denial, it is about the ongoing daily expression of our higher self. Replacing a handful of ingredients seems a small price to play our part in restoring our relationship with the non-human world. Once we become accustomed to veganism, a mental shift occurs where we don’t think of animal products as food we can’t eat, because animal products just aren’t food.</p>`;

<p>It is interesting that people commonly frame vegan dietary choices with the word "can't". It sounds almost as if it is not a voluntary choice, but something like an allergy or a religious duty. Of course it’s only a word, generally used with little thought, but it grates a little to the ear. Veganism is not about what we can and can’t do, but what we will or won’t do. It’s a subtle difference, but one that frames veganism as an active, ongoing, thoughtful, powerful choice. Most vegans don’t see being vegan as a “personal” choice, it is about reducing suffering in the world rather than anything about us personally, certainly not purity or blind adherence to an arbitrary set of rules.</p>


<p>Our so-called “personal” choices ripple outwards into the world,  what we “can’t” do is live our lives separate to that world. Eating is one of the ways we most regularly and powerfully affect the lives of others. If we could trace the origins of all the ingredients on the average dinner plate, they would generally span a vast area of the earth, involving thousands of individuals and complex processes to bring them to you. The sheer scale of the corporations feeding billions of people every day means that there are many potential ethical concerns towards the environment, animals and humans hidden in what we choose to eat. The decision to follow a vegan diet is perhaps the most powerful response to multiple aspects of our power and responsibilities as consumers.</p>


<p>What exactly is a vegan diet though, what can we and cant we not eat? The original Vegan Society based in England has a definition that most vegans take as the official definition:</p>
<blockquote>"Veganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude—as far as is possible and practicable—all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of animals, humans and the environment. In dietary terms, it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals."</blockquote>
<p>Officially the Vegan Society doesn’t consider honey vegan, however, this wasn’t always the case and they have actually gone back and forth on this at least once over their history. It’s possible more humane techniques for farming bees in the future might change this again, though considering it is an easily replaceable ingredient it is unlikely there would be much call for this. Still Veganism exists within a changing world, cell cultured meats, precision fermentation, new farming techniques and even the accuracy of many “mock”products creates an ever evolving discussion about what should and shouldn’t be called vegan. Veganism would not want to make the same mistake that many religions have, of fixing their morality at a point in time or on a set of ideas that lose relevance as the world around them changes.</p>


<p>As corporations that profit from factory farming diversify into the growing vegan market as well, it complicates things. Some vegans would prefer not to buy products from companies that also profit from selling animals, while others see it as a way of incentivising those companies to move to more ethical production. Palm oil production, or other products which cause species loss and deforestation in environmentally sensitive ecosystems, are seen by many vegans as not being consistent with a vegan ethic. Others see environmental concerns, or the concern about a relatively small number of wild animals, in comparison to the lives of billions in factory farms, as being of less ethical importance. There are many active and ongoing debates within the vegan community, usually with compassionate and defendable truths on all sides. People not immersed in the ethical considerations around veganism often speak quite clumsily about it, "can" and "can’t", but there are few ethical sharp lines in our complex world.</p>


<p>There are people who agree with all the arguments about the positive ethics of a vegan diet, but think that in specific circumstances a moratorium on eating animals doesn’t actually help animals. Some of these people call themselves “freegans”, who also engage with the globally relevant issue of food waste. While they only personally purchase vegan products, freegans will eat animal products that would otherwise be discarded, such as the vast amount thrown away by businesses when they near an arbitrary “best before” date etc. Environmentally and ethically there is little good in discarding something when all the misery and resource expenditure has already happened, so long as you are not helping create a market for it. For many vegans, the idea of eating an animal product provokes a disgust or “creepy” response in them, but they are in profound agreement that Freeganism is an ethical response to the world.</p>


<p>To complicate matters further there are people who called themselves ostro-vegans. They consider only sentience - the level of conscious awareness and ability to experience things like pleasure and pain that an individual has - in their consideration of what can be ethically consumed. The terms plant and animal seem very clear in our minds, but if we understand the basics of evolutionary science, that life is a vast interrelated tree, we’ll understand that these terms are overly simplistic. Animals evolved from plants, and there are endless forms of life at each stage from microscopic zooplankton to blue whales. Ostro-vegans delve into this blurry line between plants and animals, sentient and non-sentient. Do creatures that can’t move and don’t appear to have any of the internal wiring needed for consciousness such as clams and mussels require the same moral consideration as clearly sentient beings such as pigs, chickens, cows and tuna? Ostro-vegans think that it is ethically acceptable to eat these simpler beings, and perhaps find it a more attractive diet to follow than strict veganism. Many vegans are sympathetic to this logic, even if finding it irrelevant as their standard vegan diet already fulfils their nutritional and culinary needs.</p>


<p>The ethical journey of life is similar to what happens sometimes when climbing an unfamiliar mountain. You reach what you thought was a peak, only to find it was hiding a higher peak behind it. Part of  being vegan is finding that whatever stage we get to there are usually further steps we can take. Veganism is about embarking on  the journey of trying to live ethically, trying to make the world better, not self-denial or moral purity.</p>


<p>If we accidentally eat an animal product, as people often do when starting out, it is not really that ethically relevan because it is what we do 99.9% of the time that matters, the overall journey not the occasional errant step. If we deliberately eat an animal product, we probably shouldn’t refer to ourselves as a vegan, maybe just a vegetarian, a flexitarian or some such. Veganism is not overly dogmatic, but we should remember that it is a political statement to others about where we stand in the world. There is much to be said for displaying ethical consistency, and for providing a clear narrative light for people to follow. There are perceptions of hypocrisy that will undermine our moral authority if we ask of others things we don’t consistently do ourselves. Whatever label you present to others, freegan, ostro vegan, vegan, or some other, whether you ask for it or not you are now a representative of that idea in the world, an idea that you do not own.</p>


<p>Finally, it is often amusing that people think vegans can't eat things that are usually vegan but are not labelled as such. I’ve had all manner of things including bread, pasta, beer, avocado and peanut butter...in fairness that last one does have butter in the name. This partly shows how little people are engaged in their diet, they just accept what they are served up, what their parents served up and don’t really know what is in the foods they eat much less their repercussions on the world. If someone is open to discussion, it is a good chance to open their mind, especially to the fact that the basis of most people’s diets, especially if they follow a healthy diet, is already mostly vegan.</p>


<p>Focusing on what vegans can and can’t eat misses the forest for the trees. Eating ethically is not about ticking some boxes on a list, it is a response to deep ethical questions; is the way humans currently treat non-humans fair and are we indefinitely going to force billions of them every year to endure factory farms and slaughterhouses?</p>
