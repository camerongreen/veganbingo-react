<p>The statement "I could never give up cheese" implies a usually unacknowledged second part "even if it is cruel to animals".  Hopefully this is untrue though. Most people eat hundreds of different foods in their diets, and could swap out a couple that are inconsistent with living ethically.</p>
<p>To turn cows into milk machines involves a lot of cruelty. Cows produce the most milk when they are pregnant and in their younger fertile years. As soon as they can breed, cows are annually impregnated either by a device wielded by a farm hand (how they procure bull semen is a whole other story) or in something the industry nicknames \\"the rape rack\\" where cows are restrained to be mounted by a bull. Only half of the calves born will be female, and this creates millions of unwanted male calves. They must be taken from their mothers to ensure the calves don't drink their mothers milk, which of course is to be sold. The pain of this separation between mother and child is well documented in heartbreaking videos online. Male \\"Bobby\\" calves enter the veal trade, where they are raised in crates or sheds (depending on the country and farm) to ensure they get minimal exercise or eat anything which might toughen their flesh. They are instead fed on formula composed largely of whey protein, a byproduct of their mother's stolen milk production. They are soon slaughtered, often when just days old, but for sometimes after a few months (Left alone a bull could live to 12 years or more). The female calves will go on to suffer in turn, having their horns removed without anaesthetic, repeated pregnancies with calf separation, the lameness and over-sized udders caused by being bred as machines to produce ever more milk, mastitis from over milking, and ending with transport to the slaughterhouse when their prime years of fertility pass and they are less productive, usually between 4 to 7 years of age, when they can live 2 or 3 times longer.</p>
<p>The dairy industry is also one of the most environmentally destructive food industries on our planet for the amount of nutrition it produces, negatively contributing to deforestation, species extinction, climate change, air quality and water pollution. And whilst we mention nutrition, the majority of people in the world have lactose malabsorption, so you are likely to find giving dairy up makes you feel better. Once you give up dairy for long enough, you lose the taste for it and will even find it is a pretty unpleasant if someone accidentally serves it to you in a drink.</p>
<p>So with plenty of reasons to give up dairy, how do you actually do it? Cheese can also be replaced by anything with some fat in it, that's what people are really after anyway, avocado, various nut butters, tahini and there's a reason vegans tend to eat a lot of hummous ;) If they don't do it for you there are plant based versions of most dairy products which are getting better and more varied all the time. Milk has so many plant based options you really can't fail to find one you like, for many more than calf's milk.</p>
<p>A lot of positive change's we should make in life are hard, getting to bed earlier, exercising every day, keeping money from corrupting our political systems, etc. Giving up dairy is actually pretty easy, so why not take this rare quick win for the environment, human health, the cows, and their calves?</p>
