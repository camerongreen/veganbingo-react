const short_answer = `<p>Cheese is defined by three things, fat, salt and cruelty to animals. You can get the first two from other things while reducing the latter. People often say they feel better after giving up dairy products which is no surprise because over ⅔ of people globally have lactose malabsorption. After a while like most weaned infants we lose a taste for dairy, which is fine because there are many more delicious, more convenient and kinder alternatives. When you think about it, drinking the breast milk another species makes for its children is kind of weird, invasive and oppresive anyway.</p>`;

<p>The statement "I could never give up cheese" implies a silent unacknowledged second part "no matter how cruel or environmentally destructive it is". Hopefully people can be better than that. If people really thought about the stolen babies, bereaved mothers, swollen udders, castration, confinement, veal production, health problems and environmental degradation of the dairy corporations they might find the moral courage to make a relatively simple change.</p>


<p>To turn cows, sensitive and caring mothers, into milk machines involves regular cruelty. Milk and pregnancy are of course intertwined, and cows like humans produce more milk when they are pregnant and in their younger fertile years. As soon as they are able to bear children, young cows begin being annually impregnated either by a device wielded by a farm hand (speaking of hand, how they often procure bull semen is another story) or are impregnated in something the industry calls "the rape rack" where cows are restrained to be mounted by a bull. Half of the calves born will be male, creating vast numbers of unwanted, less profitable beings. Calves must be taken from their mothers, some only hours after being born, to ensure the calves don't drink their mother's valuable milk. The pain of this separation between cow and calf is well documented in heartbreaking videos online, showing distraught cows running behind a tractor taking away yet another calf, whilst both mother and child vocalise their pain and grief. Male "Bobby" calves are often funnelled into the veal trade, where they are raised in crates or sheds to ensure they get minimal exercise or eat anything which might toughen their flesh. Instead of their mother's milk, they are fed on formula composed largely of whey protein, a waste product of milk production. They are soon slaughtered, from just days old to, more rarely, a few months. The female calves will go on to suffer as a milk and calf production machine as their mothers did, having any horns removed without anaesthetic, repeated pregnancies with calf separation, lameness from their over-sized udders which are the result of generations of selective breeding to produce ever more milk, mastitis from over milking, all ending with transport to the slaughterhouse. Every cow in the system is destined for the slaugherhouses.  Dairy cows are killed when their fertility drops and their production is less optimal, usually between 4 to 7 years of age. Left alone they could live three to five times longer, becoming matriachs for their families.</p>


<p>Apart from routine animal cruelty, the dairy industry is also among the most environmentally destructive industries on our planet. It is a major contributor to deforestation, species extinction, climate change, water use, air and water pollution.</p>


<p>Given all these negative impacts on animals and the environment, how much do we need this industry? The majority of people in the world have lactose malabsorption and find giving up dairy makes them feel better, clears their skin etc. Far from being naturally delicious, after giving up dairy for a while people lose the taste for it and find it unpleasant. Mammals are not meant to drink milk beyond childhood, we are meant to be weaned off it. If you get used to a good quality oat or soy milk in your coffee and someone accidentally serves you calf’s milk, you will find dairy milk pretty undrinkable.</p>


<p>So if we agree that dairy is an industry that is neither kind, sustainable or necessary, how do we start moving beyond it? Butter and cheese can be replaced by anything with some fat in it. Avocado is a common go-to for sandwiches, burgers and salads, but depending on what you are eating there are various nut butters, plant oils, tahini and hundreds of variations of the amazingly versatile hummus. If they don't do it for you there are plant-based versions of most dairy products which are getting more varied all the time, soft cashew cheeses, hard cheeses, cheddar-style slices, and even blue cheeses. Milk has so many plant-based options it is hard to keep up; Oat, hemp, almond, cashew, soy, rice, coconut and various blends of them are all popular, and they come in many styles such as light, creamy and specialised barista versions. You would have to be pretty determined to not find something you like. Soy is probably the most complete nutritionally, but oat milk is generally people’s favourite taste and texture for drinks. For yoghurt and ice cream, here as well there are a vast number of alternatives and you should just try them and figure out which one you prefer.</p>


<p>Positive changes in life can be hard, getting to bed earlier, exercising every day, being loving enough, keeping money from corrupting our political systems, etc. Giving up dairy though is pretty easy, so why not take this rare quick win for compassion and the environment? It is literally as easy as adding one word like “soy” when you order coffee, or maybe asking them which plant-based milk they recommend. When you shop, just reach for a slightly different part of the shelf. A little bit of exploration, some often small changes in habits, and you will never look back.</p>


<p>Finally if cheese really is that much of a sticking point, don’t make the perfect the enemy of the good. Maybe put cheese a little lower on your list of products to change so you don’t let it be a barrier to other positive change. Some people saying giving up chicken products is the biggest step you can take to reduce animal cruelty, while others say stopping eating beef is the biggest for the environment, so maybe start there and give up cheese later. Like breaking other habits, sometimes it helps to minimise the habit first, have a transitory phase so the final break seems less of a change. Remember though millions of other people like you have made this positive change, and would never look back, so you can too. Don’t think of it as giving something up, but instead think of it as embracing your better self by leaning into your compassion and helping create a kinder world.</p>
