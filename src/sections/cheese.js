<p>The statement "I could never give up cheese" implies a silent unacknowledged second part "no matter how cruel and destructive it is". Hopefully, this is untrue though, if people knew about the taken babies, bereaved mothers, swollen udders, castration, confinement, veal production and environmental degradation of dairy production they might find the moral courage to change.</p>
<p>To turn cows into milk machines involves a lot of cruelty. Cows produce the most milk when they are pregnant and in their younger fertile years. As soon as they can breed, cows are annually impregnated either by a device wielded by a farm hand (how they procure bull semen is a whole other story) or are impregnated in something the industry nicknames "the rape rack" where cows are restrained to be mounted by a bull. Half of the calves born will be male, creating millions of unwanted calves. They must be taken from their mothers, some at just a couple of days, to ensure the calves don't drink their mother's milk, which of course is a product to be sold to. The pain of this separation between mother and child is well documented in heartbreaking videos online, distraught mothers running behind a tractor taking away yet another child, whilst the mother and the calf vocalise their pain and grief. Male "Bobby" calves enter the veal trade, where they are raised in crates or sheds to ensure they get minimal exercise or eat anything which might toughen their flesh. Instead of their mother's milk, they are fed on formula composed largely of whey protein, a byproduct of milk production. They are soon slaughtered, often when just days old, but sometimes after a few months. The female calves will go on to suffer in turn, having their horns removed without anaesthetic, repeated pregnancies with calf separation, the lameness and over-sized udders caused by being bred as machines to produce ever more milk, mastitis from over milking, and ending with transport to the slaughterhouse when their prime years of fertility pass and they are less productive, usually between 4 to 7 years of age, when they can live 2 or 3 times longer.</p>
<p>The dairy industry is also one of the most environmentally destructive food industries on our planet for the amount of nutrition it produces, negatively contributing to deforestation, species extinction, climate change, air quality and water pollution.</p>
<p>The majority of people in the world have lactose malabsorption and find giving dairy up makes them feel better. Far from being naturally delicious, eventually after giving up dairy you lose the taste for it and will find it pretty unpleasant.</p>
<p>So with plenty of reasons to give up dairy, how do you actually do it? Cheese can also be replaced by anything with some fat in it, that's what people are really after anyway, avocado, various nut butters, tahini and there's a reason vegans tend to eat so much hummous ;) If they don't do it for you there are plant-based versions of most dairy products which are getting better and more varied all the time. Milk has so many plant-based options, oat, hemp, almond, cashew, soy, rice and blends are all popular, and then there are many styles, with light and creamy, specialised barista versions, you really can't fail to find some you like. Soy is probably the most complete nutritionally, but personally, I find oat is my favourite in drinks. For yoghurt, coconut is generally the best alternative, but like milk, there are a vast number of alternatives and you should just try them and figure out which one you prefer.</p>
<p>Positive changes in life can be hard, getting to bed earlier, exercising every day, loving people enough, keeping money from corrupting our political systems, etc. Giving up dairy is actually pretty easy, so why not take this rare quick win for the cows, their calves, human health and the environment? It is literally as easy as saying a different word when you order coffee, maybe even asking them which plant-based milk they recommend. At your store, you just need to reach for something from a slightly different part of the shelf. Donâ€™t think of it as giving up cheese, think of it as giving up cruelty.</p>
