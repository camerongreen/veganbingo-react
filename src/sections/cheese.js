<p>The statement "I could never give up cheese" implies a silent unacknowledged second part "no matter how cruel and destructive it is". Hopefully, this is untrue though, if people knew about the taken babies, bereaved mothers, swollen udders, castration, confinement, veal production and environmental degradation of dairy production they might find the moral courage to change.</p>
<p>To turn cows into milk machines involves regular cruelty. Cows produce more milk when they are pregnant and in their younger fertile years. As soon as they are able to bear children, young cows are annually impregnated either by a device wielded by a farm hand (speaking of hand, how they often procure bull semen is a whole other story) or are impregnated in something the industry nicknames "the rape rack" where cows are restrained to be mounted by a bull. Half of the calves born will be male, creating millions of unwanted calves. They must be taken from their mothers, some at just a couple of days, to ensure the calves don't drink their mother's milk, which of course is a product to be sold to. The pain of this separation between cow and calf is well documented in heartbreaking videos online, distraught cows running behind a tractor taking away yet another calf, whilst both mother and child vocalise their pain and grief. Male "Bobby" calves enter the veal trade, where they are raised in crates or sheds to ensure they get minimal exercise or eat anything which might toughen their flesh. Instead of their mother's milk, they are fed on formula composed largely of whey protein, a byproduct of milk production. They are soon slaughtered, from just days old to sometimes a few months. The female calves will go on to suffer in turn, having any horns removed without anaesthetic, repeated pregnancies with calf separation, lameness from their over-sized udders caused by being bred as machines to produce ever more milk, mastitis from over milking by actual machines, and ending with transport to the slaughterhouse. They are killed when their prime years of fertility pass and their production is less optimal, usually between 4 to 7 years of age, though left alone they could live 2 or 3 times longer.</p>
<p>The dairy industry is among the most environmentally destructive industries on our planet. It is a major contributor to deforestation, species extinction, climate change, water use, air and water pollution.</p>
<p>Given all these negativite impacts on animals and the environment, how much do we need this industry? The majority of people in the world have lactose malabsorption and find giving up dairy actually makes them feel better. Far from being naturally delicious, reasonably soon after giving up dairy you lose the taste for it and will find it pretty unpleasant. Mammals are not meant to drink milk beyond childhood, we are meant to be weaned off it. If you get used to a good quality oat or soy milk in your coffee and someone accidentally serves you calf’s milk, you will find it pretty undrinkable.</p>
<p>So if you agree with any of the reasons to give up dairy, where do you start? Cheese can be replaced by anything with some fat in it, that's what people are really after anyway, avocado is my go to, but depending on what you are eating there are various nut butters, tahini and all sorts of the amazingly versatile hummouses. If they don't do it for you there are plant-based versions of most dairy products which are getting more varied all the time, soft cashew cheeses, hard cheeses, cheddar style slices, even blue cheeses. Milk has so many plant-based options, oat, hemp, almond, cashew, soy, rice, coconut and various blends of them are popular, and then there are many styles with that, light and creamy, specialised barista versions. You would have to pretty resistant to change to not find something you like. Soy is probably the most complete nutritionally, but personally, I find oat is my favourite in drinks. For yoghurt, coconut is generally the best alternative, but like milk, there are a vast number of alternatives and you should just try them and figure out which one you prefer.</p>
<p>Positive changes in life can be hard, getting to bed earlier, exercising every day, loving enough, keeping money from corrupting our political systems, etc. Giving up dairy is actually pretty easy, so why not take this rare quick win for the cows, their calves, human health and the environment? It is literally as easy as adding one word when you order coffee, maybe even asking them which plant-based milk they recommend. When you shop, you just need to reach for something from a slightly different part of the shelf. A little bit of exploration, a small change in habits, and you will never look back. Don’t think of it as giving up cheese, think of it as embracing a new world of options which conveniently are kinder to the world.</p>
