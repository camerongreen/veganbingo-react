const short_answer = `<p>Cheese is defined by three things, fat, salt and cruelty to animals. You can get the first two from other things while reducing the last. If you don’t eat dairy products, you will probably feel better because over ⅔ of people have lactose malabsorption, your skin might be a bit clearer and after a while like most weaned infants you will find you lose a taste for dairy. If you think about it drinking the breast milk of another species is weird and oppressive anyway.</p>`;

<p>The statement "I could never give up cheese" implies a silent unacknowledged second part "no matter how cruel or environmentally destructive it is". Hopefully though, people can be better than that. If they really knew about the taken babies, bereaved mothers, swollen udders, castration, confinement, veal production and environmental degradation of the dairy corporations they might find the moral courage to change.</p>


<p>To turn cows into milk machines involves regular cruelty. Cows produce more milk when they are pregnant and in their younger fertile years. As soon as they are able to bear children, young cows begin being annually impregnated either by a device wielded by a farm hand (speaking of hand, how they often procure bull semen is a whole other story) or are impregnated in something the industry calls "the rape rack" where cows are restrained to be mounted by a bull. Half of the calves born will be male, creating millions of unwanted calves. They must be taken from their mothers, some only hours after being born, to ensure the calves don't drink their mother's valuable milk. The pain of this separation between cow and calf is well documented in heartbreaking videos online, distraught cows running behind a tractor taking away yet another calf, whilst both mother and child vocalise their pain and grief. Male "Bobby" calves are funnelled into the veal trade, where they are raised in crates or sheds to ensure they get minimal exercise or eat anything which might toughen their flesh. Instead of their mother's milk, they are fed on formula composed largely of whey protein, a waste product of milk production. They are soon slaughtered, from just days old to, more rarely, a few months. The female calves will go on to suffer as a milk and calf production machine as their mothers did, having any horns removed without anaesthetic, repeated pregnancies with calf separation, lameness from their over-sized udders which are the result of generations of selective breeding to produce ever more milk, mastitis from over milking, all ending with transport to the slaughterhouse. Their killing happens when their fertility drops and their production is less optimal, usually between 4 to 7 years of age. Left alone they could live much longer.</p>
<p>Apart from routine animal cruelty, the dairy industry is also among the most environmentally destructive industries on our planet. It is a major contributor to deforestation, species extinction, climate change, water use, air and water pollution.</p>


<p>Given all these negative impacts on animals and the environment, how much do we need this industry? The majority of people in the world have lactose malabsorption and find giving up dairy makes them feel better, clears their skin etc. Far from being naturally delicious, after giving up dairy for a while people lose the taste for it and find it unpleasant. Mammals are not meant to drink milk beyond childhood, we are meant to be weaned off it. If you get used to a good quality oat or soy milk in your coffee and someone accidentally serves you calf’s milk, you will find dairy milk pretty undrinkable.</p>
<p>So if you agree that dairy is an industry we neither need nor want, how do we start moving beyond it? Butter and cheese can be replaced by anything with some fat in it, that's what people are really after anyway.  Avocado is a common go-to, but depending on what you are eating there are various nut butter, plant oils, tahini and all sorts of the amazingly versatile hummus. If they don't do it for you there are plant-based versions of most dairy products which are getting more varied all the time, soft cashew cheeses, hard cheeses, cheddar-style slices, and even blue cheeses. Milk has so many plant-based options it is hard to keep up; Oat, hemp, almond, cashew, soy, rice, coconut and various blends of them are all popular, and they come in many styles such as light, creamy and specialised barista versions. You would have to be pretty determined to not find something you like. Soy is probably the most complete nutritionally, but oat milk is generally people’s favourite for drinks. For yoghurt and ice cream, coconut is a good alternative, but here as well there are a vast number of alternatives and you should just try them and figure out which one you prefer.</p>


<p>Positive changes in life can be hard, getting to bed earlier, exercising every day, loving enough, keeping money from corrupting our political systems, etc. Giving up dairy though is pretty easy, so why not take this rare quick win for animals and the environment? It is literally as easy as adding one word like “soy” when you order coffee, or maybe asking them which plant-based milk they recommend. When you shop, just reach for something from a slightly different part of the shelf. A little bit of exploration, some often small changes in habits, and you will never look back.</p>


<p>Finally if cheese really is that much of a sticking point, maybe put it a little lower on your list of products to change so you don’t let it be a barrier to other positive change. Like breaking other habits, sometimes it helps to minimise the habit first, have a transitory phase so the final break seems less of a change. Remember though millions of other people have made this positive change and would never look back, so you can too. Don’t think of it as giving something up, but instead think of it as embracing your compassion and helping create a kinder world.</p>
