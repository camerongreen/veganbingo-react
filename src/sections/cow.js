const short_answer = `<p>It should come as little surprise that intensive livestock farming is intensively controlled. Livestock breeding is highly artificial and responds to the laws of supply and demand rather than those of nature. If people stop eating animals, farmers would breed fewer of them. It may be interesting to think about “what if we just stopped eating animals?” but this is unlikely to happen, it will be a gradual transition giving society time to adjust.</p>`;

<p>People often say things that reveal how divorced they are from the reality of modern industrial farming. It is far removed from the cow with a daisy in its mouth, or an anthropomorphised pig smiling in the sunshine that the industry promotes by its packaging and advertisements. Using animal bodies for food production is big business run by corporations to maximise profits for their owners and investors. Insemination is highly artificial, bloodlines and genetics are strictly controlled.</p>
<p>Breeding programmes care little about the lives of the animals unless they interfere with profit. Turkeys for instance have had their bodies so warped by selective breeding they are no longer capable of propagating naturally. Many farm animals live with a body that outgrows the ability of their skeleton and internal organs to support them. Slaughtered when still children, it is perhaps a mercy for many to die at such a young age rather than live with the mutations we have bred into them. Luckily for those animals if the industry stops breeding them, they will largely disappear in a generation.</p>
<p>Of course it’s not a well-thought-through question as it is unlikely that the end of industrial animal farming will happen overnight. People give up things gradually, ideas often spread slowly among societies. Vegans are still a minority, far from any position enabling us to legislate less cruel farming practises tomorrow. Our dairy and meat-eating, often paradoxically self-proclaimed “animal-loving”, friends needn’t worry. They can give up animal products without losing sleep over the nightmarish idea of animals being free to live life according to their own desires. The real nightmare is of course what eating animals on an industrial scale has created in our world now, with the hook, cage, brand, barbed wire, whip, electric prod, slaughterhouse and countless other tools of animal oppression.</p>


<p>As for what will happen to the jobs of the animal farmers, butchers, slaughterhouse workers and others in the livestock industry, that positive change will happen equally gradually. People will transition to other work and products, just like so many changes for the better in industries and technologies have happened in the past. People will still need to eat the same amount of calories and nutrients, the market will adapt to whatever other things they choose. If fewer people live psychologically traumatising lives slaughtering animals day after day in sheds hidden away from the rest of society, then that's a good thing. There might even be compensation required if society legislates an end to cruel farming practices, in the same way slave owners were often compensated when slavery was abolished. Although we look at the compensations of slave owners as strange and unjust now, engaging as they did in what would now be (and should have always been) a criminal enterprise, it was perhaps necessary to move forward in the society of its time. Most people know that factory farming is cruel, but it will perhaps take some distance from it, to not think that they personally benefit from it, before many people will be able to comprehend the full horror of it.</p>


<p>As for all the open fields in the countryside, people may have grown accustomed to its current state, but we have made a desolation and called it peace. We rarely think about the story of who and what lived there before and how they were removed or dispossessed. These were not monocultures of introduced species but bustling ecosystems with life in endless forms, integrating millions of years of evolutionary wisdom in their subtle balance. At least some of the workers freed from animal production industries could find meaningful work rewilding and restoring the places we have so denuded, giving the native flora and fauna a chance to return. The benefits of rewilding these places would be many. Livestock farming, and the crops grown to feed them, cover a huge percentage of the earth’s surface. The UN environmental agencies have long pointed out that livestock farming is one of the primary causes of species extinction, deforestation, water pollution, air pollution and most other environmental problems. This monopolisation of land threatens not just non-humans, much of the land of dispossessed poor and indigenous people was taken to farm high-profit livestock by privileged elites or colonisers. The already large carbon footprint of livestock farming quoted by bodies like the UN completely does not include the carbon reduction benefits we would all share by rewilding millions of acres of pasture and cropland currently dedicated to livestock and their feed.</p>


<p>What does that barbed wire surrounding fields say about the lives of the animals who live there and our relationship with them? We are living through the Anthropocene, a term that acknowledges the effect humans currently have on the living systems of the world, especially since the industrial revolution. Humanity has collectively abused our ever-growing power to selfishly diminish a natural world we should share. Our livestock are an extension of this. Chickens alone are two-thirds of the mass of all birds. Humans and their livestock comprise 96% of the mass of terrestrial species, with all wild species crowded into the remaining 4% and many of them are diminishing or disappearing. Humans have utilised our intelligence and organisational abilities to create a tyranny of all other species.</p>
<p>The religions and philosophies of developed societies centre around human supremacy, with only the gods of our imagination being higher, gods who are also revealing obsessed with us. We see anthropocentrism reflected in the way we live, the things we consume and the technology we create. Finding a way to reintegrate human civilisation into the natural world seems to be the only path forward for humanity that is not built on the oppression of everything else that lives. Everything we know about the positive effects of spending time in nature for human well-being also tells us that as nature restores itself we will have a more beautiful and fulfilling life as well.</p>


<p>A new world awaits when more of us shake off the habits and ideas of the past to imagine a more equitable relationship between us and the other species who share our world. All life has its own evolutionary paths separate from ours and we can flourish best together. We should stop believing that simply having the power to control the lives of other animals gives us any right to do so, especially when it is so evident we do not yet have the collective maturity to responsibly wield that power. Oppression not only damages the oppressed, but it limits the vision and full flourishing of the oppressor. The livestock industry is a symptom of our myopia, and we should only celebrate its gradual replacement because it will reflect a wider ethical progression for our species.</p>
