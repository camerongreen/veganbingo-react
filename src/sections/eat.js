const short_answer = `<p>Anyone who thinks the millions of people who eat a vegan diet are all wasting away to nothing, clearly hasn't met many vegans. Most vegans will tell you they eat a greater variety of food as a vegan than they did before. Vegans come in all shapes and sizes, from athletic, to voluptuous, to slim, to powerful, because being vegan is about reducing cruelty, not pleasure.</p>`;

<p>Google tells me there are 20,000 plants that people eat. Well the first result did, the second said 200,000, the next 300,000, the next 80,000, so the exact number varies but it's clearly a lot. There are foods you have never heard of that people eat in other countries, that you would like so much it would make your toes curl. Most people eat a limited subset of foods available in the world, and think there is nothing else. When you tell them you are vegan, they think of their own diet with a handful of things removed, things that are often the psychological centre of their meals. To be fair this is what some vegans initially do, and they often don't thrive because it becomes a diet of lack and self-denial that isn't healthy or as interesting.</p>
<p>Healthy veganism embraces a different sort of food pyramid. We remove the animal products but don't just stop there, we replace them with a wide variety of other plant-based foods. Anyone eating a healthy diet that most peak nutritional organisations recommend, is probably already eating a diet that is mostly vegan. Vegans then replace the animal product portion of their diet with nuts, seeds, beans, legumes, grains, fungi, tofu, tempeh, seitan. Milk is a good example of the variety we have, instead of just one sort we have soy, almond, macadamia, cashew oat, rice, hemp, quinoa, coconut and more. Everything else you want can be found in a plant based version these days too, plant based cheeses, marshmallows, milk chocolate (a lot of dark choc has always been vegan), condensed milk, mayonnaise, yoghurt, haggis, black pudding, bacon, you get the idea.</p>
<p>There will be some who identify as junk-food vegans that will roll their eyes at some of the health discussion above and say they went vegan for the animals not their health. They tend to buy the plant based meats and cheeses and want them to look and taste as close to the real thing as possible. This is fine and can make the transition easier, but taken too far it misses out on potential health benefits of being vegan, and make it more expensive than it needs to be.</p>
<p>Sources of vegan protein are also some of the cheapest things you can feed yourself on, beans, legumes and grains.  Even tofu and tempeh are equivalently priced to animal products. One of healthiest diet's ever studied, what is termed a Wholefoods Plant Based Diet, is also the cheapest diet. Win for your pocket, the animals, and your health.</p>
<p>The thought of being vegan may seem hard, but most vegans will tell you that once they made the change it became pretty automatic. Most of us eat the same dishes regularly and buy the same general things at the supermarket. Once you find a handful of good regular dishes, you are most of the way there. A good starter list would include a curry, a stir-fry, a bolognese sauce, a burger patty and a couple of good soups such as minestrone or red lentil. Whether you are just starting to cook, or are a foodie, there is an infinite world of vegan blogs, video tutorials, meal plans, shopping tips and recipe suggestions out there.</p>
<p>A good place to start finding out what vegans eat is to Google your favourite dish followed by "vegan", then get in the kitchen and start experimenting!</p>
