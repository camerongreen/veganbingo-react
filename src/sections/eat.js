const short_answer = `<p>Anyone who thinks the millions of people who eat a vegan diet are all wasting away to nothing, clearly hasn't met enough vegans. Most vegans will tell you they eat a greater variety of food as a vegan than they did before. Vegans come in all shapes and sizes, from slim to voluptuous, athletic to wiry, and pudgy to powerful, because veganism is about compassion, not purity or denial.</p>`;

<p>Google tells me there are 20,000 plants that people eat. Well the first result did, the second said 200,000, the next 300,000, the next 80,000. Luckily for our purposes, the exact number is not important, so let’s just say it is clearly a lot. There are foods you have never heard of that people eat regularly in other countries, some you might really love if you tried them. We all eat a pretty limited subset of foods available in the world and assume there isn’t that much else, but even in our own societies, there are people, especially from different cultures, eating many unfamiliar foods to us.</p>
<p>When you someone you are vegan, they picture their own diet with a handful of things removed, things that are often the psychological centre of their meals. To be fair this is what some vegans initially do, and they often don't thrive because it becomes a diet of lack and self-denial that isn't healthy or interesting. People who thrive on a vegan diet educate themselves on what to add to their diet to make sure it is nutritionally complete or optimal for their palate, lifestyle and goals.</p>
<p>Healthy veganism embraces a slightly different food pyramid. We leave the fruits, vegetables and whole grains that are the essential foundation of any healthy diet. We remove the animal products but don't stop there, we replace them with a wide variety of other plant-based foods. People eating the sort of diet peak nutritional organisations recommend are probably already eating a mostly plant-based diet. A healthy vegan diet just replaces animal products with things like nuts, seeds, beans, legumes, grains, fungi, tofu, tempeh, mushrooms, and seitan. Milk is a good example of the variety vegans have in replacing an animal product, instead of just one sort we have soy, almond, macadamia, cashew oat, rice, hemp, quinoa, coconut and more. Almost every animal product also has a commercial plant-based version these days too, plant-based cheeses, marshmallows, milk chocolate (a lot of dark choc has always been vegan), condensed milk, mayonnaise, yoghurt, haggis, black pudding, bacon, you get the idea. A diet reliant on these products would be expensive, but eating them regularly rather than cheaper whole foods isn’t nutritionally optimal anyway. Eat beans, not beings as we say!</p>
<p>There will be some who identify as junk-food vegans that will roll their eyes at some of the health discussions above and say they went vegan for the animals, not their health. They tend to centre their diet on plant-based meats and dairy products and essentially haven’t changed the shape of their diet after going vegan. This is still better for the planet and animals and eases the transition from being non-vegan, but it misses out on potential health benefits and costs more.</p>
<p>Sources of vegan protein are also some of the cheapest things you can feed yourself on, beans, legumes and grains. Tofu and tempeh, staples for many communities, are competitively priced compared with animal products. One of the healthiest diets ever studied, a Whole-foods Plant-Based Diet, can also be one of the cheapest. If you are willing to invest a little more time in cooking it can be a win for your pocket, the animals, and your health.</p>
<p>The thought of being vegan may seem hard, but most vegans will tell you that once they made the change it becomes just as automatic as their previous habits. Most of us eat the same dishes regularly, frequent the same restaurants and buy the same general list of items at the supermarket. Once you find a handful of good regular dishes, you are most of the way there. A good starter list would include a curry, a stir-fry, a bolognese sauce, a burger patty and a couple of good soups such as minestrone or red lentil. Whether you are just starting to cook, or are a foodie, there is an infinite world of vegan blogs, video tutorials, meal plans, shopping tips and recipe suggestions out there.A good place to start finding out what vegans eat is to do an Internet search for your favourite dishes followed by "vegan", then get in the kitchen and start experimenting!</p>
<p>The same goes for finding vegan and vegan-friendly restaurants and places to eat out. Try typing in “Vegan restaurants in” followed by wherever you happen to be and you’ll see an ever-growing list of places in most major cities. If you are a traveller or want to make your life even easier download the free Happy Cow mobile application or visit their website. A community of people around the world contribute to maintaining lists of local restaurants, stores and more with photos, ratings and reviews. You can also start giving back to the vegan movement, by adding your own reviews and restaurants you’ve found and updating any which need it.</p>
<p>Habits can be powerful things, they stop us from living our best life, or they can help us maintain it. Moments of transition in our lives are thus pregnant with possibilities, for positive or negative transformation. If you are wondering what vegans eat, do some research, deepen your knowledge, and give yourself the best chance of making it a permanent and positive change for you, the environment and the animals who share this world with us.</p>
