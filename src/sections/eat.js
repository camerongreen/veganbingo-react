const short_answer = `<p>Anyone who thinks the millions of vegans in the world are all wasting away trying to find something to eat, clearly hasn't met many vegans. Vegans come in all shapes and sizes, from slim to voluptuous, athletic to wiry, couch potato to powerlifter. Veganism is about compassion, not denial or purity. Most of us have access to a historically unprecedented variety of food options, it has never been easier to make compassionate choices, nor has there ever been a time when it was more vitally important we do so.</p>`;

<p>Google tells me there are 20,000 plants that people eat. Well the first result did, another said it was 300,000, the following one 80,000 and so on. Luckily for our purposes, the exact number is unimportant, it is clearly a lot. There are many thousands of fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts and pulses that you have never heard of. Many foods unfamiliar to us are core delicacies of the diet of other cultures. We eat a limited subset of the vast variety of plant foods and mistakenly assume there isn’t that much else, but there is a world to explore.</p>


<p>When you tell someone you are vegan, they picture their own diet with animal products removed. Although animal products sometimes form the psychological centre of people’s meals, especially for males, in actuality it is only a handful of ingredients they would need to replace. For animal flesh (excluding fish) for instance, many people almost exclusively eat only three ingredients, the flesh of chickens, cows and pigs. If you also remove eggs and products made from cow’s milk, you have cut out almost all of the animal products most people eat, basically by removing 5 ingredients. Unfortunately, some people who try a vegan diet just do this, they remove those foods from their plates without an understanding of what to replace them with, and it becomes a diet of self-denial that isn’t as healthy and interesting as it could be. We can do better than this though, we don’t just remove, we replace to maintain or even improve the nutritional and sensual pleasures of food. Ask any healthy, long-term vegan and they will tell you they eat a greater variety of foods since going vegan than they did before. People thriving on a vegan diet have educated themselves on what healthy plant foods they can add to their plate to make it nutritionally complete and pleasurably palatable.</p>


<p>Veganism embraces an adjusted food pyramid but will be largely familiar to anyone eating a healthy diet. The same whole grains, vegetables and fruits create the foundation and majority of calories. We replace other parts of the pyramid with some of the incredible variety of plant-based foods which are high in proteins, healthy fats, calcium, iron and omega 3s etc. People eating a diet similar to the one recommended by the world’s peak nutritional organisations will already be eating a diet closely resembling the plant-based pyramid, and everyone else probably should at least be doing so. To then adjust this to a healthy, complete, more compassionate plant food diet, vegans replace animal products with things like nuts, seeds, beans, legumes, grains, fungi, tofu, tempeh, mushrooms, soy and seitan. Once you start to understand where your nutrients are coming from you can adjust the sources of them, the protein, fats, iron and so on by eating foods optimal for your personal goals.</p>


<p>Milk is a good example of the variety vegans have in substituting an animal product, instead of just one sort we have soy, almond, macadamia, cashew oat, rice, hemp, quinoa, coconut and many more. Almost every animal product has a number of commercial plant-based versions from plant-based cheeses, marshmallows, milk chocolate (a lot of dark choc has always been vegan), condensed milk, mayonnaise, yoghurt, haggis, black pudding, bacon, you get the idea. A diet reliant on these “mock” products could get expensive, but eating them regularly rather than cheaper whole foods isn’t nutritionally optimal anyway. A common vegan proverb is “Eat beans, not beings”, because beans are the cheapest, most diverse and healthiest plant-based replacement around.</p>


<p>Some who identify as “junk-food vegans” might roll their eyes at all of this health discussion and say veganism is not a diet, it is a philosophy aimed at reducing animal suffering, not optimising human health. Junk food vegans tend to centre their diet on convenience products, plant-based meats and dairy products, and essentially haven’t changed the shape of their diet after going vegan. This is still a win for the planet and animals and can ease the transition from being non-vegan for many, but it can be expensive and miss out on potential health benefits. Rice, beans, lentils and starchy roots, the basis of many traditional diets are some of the cheapest, healthiest foods you can buy and the basis of many traditional diets. They aren’t necessarily the most convenient to prepare, or the most pleasurably sinful, so it’s up to each person if and how they integrate convenience products into their diet.</p>


<p>One of the healthiest diets ever studied happens to be vegan and is called a Whole-foods Plant-Based Diet. It is not coincidentally based on traditional world cuisines, where the flavour was put into foods by herbs, spices, skilful cooking and good quality ingredients, not just processed oil, sugar and salt. Whatever amount of time you are willing to invest in learning how to cook a WFPB diet will be a win for your pocket, the animals, and the health of you and your loved ones. Creating healthy plant meals is a personal skill that reverberates positively into your relationships and the world.</p>


<p>The idea of adopting a vegan lifestyle may seem new and even daunting, but most vegans will tell you that once acquired, new habits quickly become just as automatic as old ones. There is an adjustment needed, you’ll be reading ingredients a lot more, but we shouldn’t overestimate how much change is required for significant progress. Most people, vegan or otherwise, have a small rotation of regular dishes, frequent regular restaurants and buy more or less the same items when they do grocery shopping. Once you get the hang of these core changes, most of the progress is made. For people who cook, finding a good roster of regular dishes, often veganised variations on the ones you already like, is the perfect way to start. Whether you are just starting to cook, or are a foodie, there is an infinite world of vegan blogs, video tutorials, meal plans, shopping tips and recipe suggestions out there. As with learning most things, a good, free place to begin is a few Internet searches. Type any dish followed by "vegan", then get in the kitchen and start trying out some of the different versions people have shared.</p>


<p>The Internet is also your friend in finding vegan and vegan-friendly restaurants and places to eat out. Try typing “Vegan restaurants” followed by wherever you happen to be and you’ll see an ever-growing and changing list of places in most major cities. If you want to make your life even easier, especially when travelling, download the free Happy Cow mobile application or visit their website happycow.net. A community of people around the world contribute to maintaining this global list of restaurants, stores and more with photos, ratings and reviews. You can also dip a toe into the worldwide vegan movement by adding your own reviews and restaurants you’ve found and updating any which need it.</p>


<p>Habits can be powerful things, they can stop us from living our best life, or they can help us create and maintain it. It is interesting to talk to people who have made major life changes and who now barely recognise or understand the person they were before. Most vegans believe that one day an ethical evolution will happen to the whole human race, and that this will be seen as a strange and dark age with respect to our treatment of animals. We will scarcely believe that the oppression of other species was not only legal but the status quo; that so many gave so little thought to the suffering of billions in factory farms and their murder in slaughterhouses. When you realise our treatment of animals is not only immoral but also unnecessary, and that we can eat beautifully and healthfully without participating in this oppressive system, then you are ready to play your part in bringing a better shared future into being.</p>
