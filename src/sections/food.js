const short_answer = `<p>We can turn this around and ask - why aren't meat eaters eating things resembling meat? Why aren't there raw flesh restaurants everywhere? If love animal flesh is so great, why do meat eaters go to such efforts to hide its taste and texture by cooking, spicing, saucing etc?</p>`;

<p>For a start, most animal products do not look like animal products. I don't want to spoil any childhood delusions, but fish don't actually have fingers. Cheese, butter, sausages, milk, burgers, they all go through a production process that changes them significantly from their natural state. What we love is cooking...the clever way things can be combined to create culinary experiences.</p>
<p>Take a burger, is that really defined by being made of animals? People focus mentally on the animal products in a burger, like many other meals, when they are often just a portion of the total calories. In your average fast food hamburger, the patty itself often has grains, flavours, herbs, spices, vegetables such as onions, flours or breadcrumbs, colourings and often preservatives. After being burnt to change the texture and flavour, it is then encased in bread, tomato, lettuce, pickle, onions, (plus beetroot in Australia!) and smothered in sauces. Often the meat is less than a fifth of the end product which doesn't in any way resemble, or even taste like the animal flesh in the patty would have naturally.</p>
<p>Almost every animal product has a similar story, processed, cooked, flavoured and spiced, the actual taste of the original animal product is masked. What people who go vegan often realise is that it wasn't the taste of meat that added much to food, it was their use as an ingredient in a meal, the texture, the fat content, the protein. These can all be replaced with other things with similar properties, and if we then add all those same spices and flavours, cook it in the same way, we end up with a pretty similar experience.</p>
<p>When it comes to what we replace animal protein with, we have a wide array, not just tofu. Beans and lentils are the easiest drop in replacements, but there also nuts, seeds, grains, mushrooms, seitan, soy derivatives and other alternatives from the wide and diverse plant kingdom. There are also lots of commercially made products which are designed to be easy drop in replacements for animal products in a meal. These vegan alternatives are getting better and more varied all the time as veganism grows and becomes more commercially profitable. People often prejudge plant-based food as boring, but plenty of blind studies have shown people like the taste of plant-based alternatives, so it's a more of a mental shift many people need to make. It is a new way of eating more many though, so Just like we all did when growing up, we need to take our time, experiment with different foods, and find the things we like from the ever-increasing number of options out there.</p>
<p>Ultimately people who ask this are missing the point. It is oppression and violence that we oppose, not a particular ingredient's texture, shape or flavour. Many vegans avoid products resembling animal foods because they have uncomfortable connotations for them, and that is their right. Others are happy eating anything so long as they aren't contributing to factory farming, and that is their right. Both are ethical choices. People eating animals should focus on the ethics of what they eat, as opposed to the aesthetics of what vegans eat.</p>
