<p>This begs the question, why aren't meat eaters eating things resembling animal parts? A rissole, a burger pattie, a sausage, a bolognese, none of them exist in nature. If animal flesh is so naturally delicious and appealing, why aren't there restaurants everywhere giving it to carnists straight? Raw severed leg anyone? Instead, animal flesh is sold after shaping, spicing, marinating, saucing, texturing, removing the skin, bones, organs, head, tail, hooves, draining the blood and burning. Vegans cook in similar ways, co-opting the same recipes that they grew up culturally eating, except that we exclude the murdered animal from the process.</p>


<p>Whilst we are talking about co-option, it’s interesting that the word meat didn’t use to mean animal flesh, it just meant substantial food. Before refrigeration and factory farming consuming animal products in the quantities now common was unrealisable for the average person, especially those living in cities. Looking at most cultural cuisines you will see this, historically they were primarily plant-based. They only became so animal product-heavy relatively recently and thus the definition of meat changed to mean animal products.</p>


<p>So we should acknowledge that most animal products do not look like animal products. We don't want to spoil any delusions, but most fish don't have fingers and buffaloes don’t have wings. Cheese, butter, sausages, milk and burgers, all go through a production process that changes them significantly from their natural state. What we like is cooking, combining, mixing, shaping, flavouring and cleverly creating different culinary experiences. Tofu is a good example of this, people eat it raw and find it unpalatable, but you could say the same about a potato. Few people who like tofu eat it raw, they add some salt and pepper, a marinade, cook it in various ways, then maybe a bit of sauce, some side veggies and suddenly you have a tasty dish.</p>


<p>People focus mentally on the animal products in a burger, like many other meals, when they are often just a portion of the total calories. Take the communion wafer of modern consumerism, the Big Mac, is that really defined by being made of animals? In your average fast food hamburger, the patty itself often has grains, flavours, herbs, spices, vegetables such as onions, flours or breadcrumbs, colourings and often preservatives. After the flesh is minced to change the texture, it has things added to it to change the flavour, it is then burnt to further change the texture and flavour, it is then encased in bread, tomato, lettuce, pickle, onions, maybe sliced beetroot if you are in Australia and then smothered with mayonnaise, mustard and sauces. Often the meat is a relatively small portion of the end product which barely resembles, or even tastes like animal flesh would have naturally. If vegans replace that part of the burger with some plant-based protein source, mainly for mouth chew and texture rather than flavour, we still get a pretty similar end experience. Why people get offended by that is hard to fathom, and how they can find that more offensive than slaughterhouses and factory farms is a mystery for the ages.</p>


<p>Almost every animal product has a similar story, processed, cooked, flavoured and spiced, the actual taste of the original animal product is enhanced, changed or masked. What people who go vegan often realise is that it wasn't the taste of meat that added much to food, it was their practical use as an ingredient in a meal, the texture, the fat content and the protein. Texture particularly is important, a burger without a patty is a little too easy to chew through, so Vegans want something in there doing a similar thing, something that wasn’t part of a murdered animal. Everything an animal product brings to a meal can be replaced with other things with similar properties, and if we then add all those same spices and flavours and cook it in the same way, we end up with something that ticks the pleasure boxes for us. Is it exactly the same? Actually sometimes a little scarily yes, but most of the time no, but your tastes and expectations adjust. Go to a good vegan restaurant and you will see people eating and talking happily like any restaurant, full of the same joy of food and life, just without the shadow of death lurking nearby.</p>


<p>When it comes to what we replace animal protein with, we have a wide array, not just tofu as some people seem to think. Beans and lentils are the easiest, cheapest and often healthiest drop-in replacements, but there are also nuts, seeds, grains, mushrooms, seitan, soy derivatives and other alternatives from the wide and diverse plant kingdom. There are also lots of commercially made products that are designed to be like-for-like replacements for animal products in a meal and are especially helpful for people making the transition. These vegan alternatives are getting better and more varied all the time as veganism grows and becomes more commercially profitable. People often prejudge plant-based food as boring, but plenty of blind studies have shown people like the taste of plant-based alternatives, so it's more of a mental shift many people need to make. It is a new way of eating for many though, so as we all did for our current diet, we need to relearn a little what foods we like and don’t like from the ever-increasing number of vegan options out there. We need to experiment with different plant-based recipes and options, and figure out the staples that are going to form the core of our diet.</p>


<p>Ultimately people who ask why vegans might eat a completely veggie sausage (veggie sausages by the way have been around since they were introduced as part of rationing during the first world war) are missing the point. We don’t eat animal products because of oppression and violence, not a particular ingredient's texture, shape or flavour. A lot of vegans do avoid products resembling animal foods because they have uncomfortable connotations for them, and that is their right. Others are happy eating anything so long as it isn't contributing to factory farming, and actually see eating something that resembles an animal product as a clear evidence of how little we actually need to give up to live more compassionately. Both are ethical choices and surely that’s the important thing, not the arbitrary shape or flavour of what people eat.</p>


<p>There are many things we could get offended by in the world, but we need to have some sense of proportion about what actually matters. If you are offended by someone happily eating a veggie sausage, and not by billions of animals suffering in slaughterhouses and factory farms, perhaps this is an indication that you need to reconsider your ethical framework. People getting upset about the aesthetics of what other people eat would do much more good in the world channelling their energy into re-evaluating the ethics of what they eat.</p>
