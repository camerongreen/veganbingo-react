const short_answer = `<p>We can answer this but first, why aren't meat eaters eating things resembling animal parts? A rissole, a burger pattie, a sausage, a bolognese, none of them exist in nature. If animal flesh is so naturally delicious to humans, why aren't there raw flesh restaurants everywhere giving it to them straight? Instead, animal flesh is sold after cooking, spicing, marinating, saucing and often even changing the texture.</p>`;

<p>Whilst we are talking about co-option, it’s interesting that the word meat didn’t use to mean animal flesh, it just meant substantial food. Before refrigeration and factory farming consuming animal products in the quantities now common was unrealisable for the average person, especially those living in cities. Looking at most cultural cuisines you will see this, historically they were primarily plant-based and only became meat-heavy relatively recently.</p>
<p>So we should acknowledge most animal products do not look like animal products. I don't want to spoil any childhood delusions, but fish don't actually have fingers. Cheese, butter, sausages, milk and burgers, all go through a production process that changes them significantly from their natural state. What we like is cooking, combining, mixing, shaping, flavouring and cleverly creating different culinary experiences.</p>
<p>Take the communion wafer of modern consumerism, the Big Mac, is that really defined by being made of animals? People focus mentally on the animal products in a burger, like many other meals, when they are often just a portion of the total calories. In your average fast food hamburger, the patty itself often has grains, flavours, herbs, spices, vegetables such as onions, flours or breadcrumbs, colourings and often preservatives. After the flesh is minced to change the texture, has things added to it to change the flavour, it is then burnt to further change the texture and flavour, it is then encased in bread, tomato, lettuce, pickle, onions, maybe sliced beetroot if you are in Australia and then smothered with mayonnaise, mustards or sauces. Often the meat is less than a fifth of the end product which doesn't in any way resemble, or even taste like the animal flesh in the patty would have naturally. If vegans replace that part of the burger with some plant-based protein source we still get a pretty similar end experience.</p>
<p>Almost every animal product has a similar story, processed, cooked, flavoured and spiced, the actual taste of the original animal product is masked. What people who go vegan often realise is that it wasn't the taste of meat that added much to food, it was their use as an ingredient in a meal, the texture, the fat content and the protein. These can all be replaced with other things with similar properties, and if we then add all those same spices and flavours and cook it in the same way, we end up with something that ticks the pleasure boxes for us.</p>
<p>When it comes to what we replace animal protein with, we have a wide array, not just tofu. Beans and lentils are the easiest drop-in replacements, but there are also nuts, seeds, grains, mushrooms, seitan, soy derivatives and other alternatives from the wide and diverse plant kingdom. There are also lots of commercially made products that are designed to be easy drop-in replacements for animal products in a meal. These vegan alternatives are getting better and more varied all the time as veganism grows and becomes more commercially profitable. People often prejudge plant-based food as boring, but plenty of blind studies have shown people like the taste of plant-based alternatives, so it's more of a mental shift many people need to make. It is a new way of eating for many though, so as we all did when growing up and learnt what foods we liked, we need to experiment with different plant-based options, and figure out the things we like and don’t like from the ever-increasing number of options out there.</p>
<p>Ultimately people who ask this are missing the point. It is oppression and violence that we oppose, not a particular ingredient's texture, shape or flavour. Many vegans avoid products resembling animal foods because they have uncomfortable connotations for them, and that is their right. Others are happy eating anything so long as they aren't contributing to factory farming, and that is cool too. Both are ethical choices and surely that’s the important thing, not the arbitrary shape or flavour of what people eat. People who get upset about the aesthetics of what vegans eat would do much more good in the world if they were to channel their energy into thinking about the ethics of what they eat.</p>
