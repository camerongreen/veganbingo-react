It is also perversely ironic to use evil involving mass killing to justify such vast unnecessary mass killing. Veganism is about compassion for all animals and that includes humans, anyone thinking or acting otherwise hasn’t understood its message.</p>`;

<p>Hitler, Pol Pot and Manson never claimed to be vegan, but we still hear this so let's go. We should first acknowledge that most evil people will have eaten vegetables at some point in their lives, maybe even a lot of vegetables. We also acknowledge the statistical likelihood that some of the many millions of people who have been vegetarian will have been terrible people. That a plant-based diet or philosophy in any way caused these people to be terrible is something of a stretch.</p>


<p>Tolstoy said vegetarianism shows someone's pursuit of moral perfection is sincere. This probably needs an update to “veganism”, and it sounds nice but not everyone gives up eating meat for ethics or the pursuit of morality. Health, religion, spirituality, culture, digestion issues, allergies and even impressing a hot vegan friend are all common. Most people are ethical in some areas but have moral blind spots in others, so we need to know more about someone to say if they are overall a good person than one trait. Families in India have abstained from meat for centuries, but it's doubtful every single person they produced was some sort of saintly figure. Vegetarians and vegans are regular people, often flawed, trying to figure out this life as they go along like everyone else.</p>


<p>Now let's add to the millions of wasted words talking about Hitler. He ate meat until he was almost 50, by which time he had taken over Germany and was having people killed and put in concentration camps. It was 1942, well into the war, before he ever seemed to identify as a vegetarian. So the claim is on shaky ground straight away, if we think his diet was in any way related to his crimes, it is not his late vegetarianism we should be looking at but his 50 years of meat eating before it. He had long-term stomach problems, and some say doctors put him on a mostly vegetarian diet around 1937, though Herman Hess said he made exceptions for things like liver dumplings. Even later on, people apparently unafraid of the consequences of crossing Hitler snuck meat into his food right to his end, and if he noticed he would complain about it hurting his stomach. His chef claimed she used animal broth in cooking for him and his dietitian claims to have snuck bone marrow into his food. So how much he was actually vegetarian is hard to tell, from these anecdotes it could be said he never was. Hitler did show some concern for animals, liked dogs and the Nazis did enact laws against animal cruelty, but if people were just pure evil history  would be a lot simpler. The Nazis also had social programmes and helped the poor, so although the Nazis as a collective were incomprehensibly vile, not every single thing they did was. As the saying goes, even a stopped clock can be right twice a day.</p>


<p>On to Pol Pot and his murderous regime. This was relatively recent, the people who cooked for him are still alive, and they say he ate all sorts of things, fish, cobra, boar etc. An official who knew him seemed to say he was a vegetarian, but who knows what they were basing that on? As an aside, we must understand that many people get confused about what the word vegetarian means, especially in the past. A relevant passage talking about Hitler’s diet from the New York Times in 1937 says “It is well known that Hitler is a vegetarian” which they then follow with “he occasionally relishes a slice of ham and relieves the tediousness of his diet with such delicacies as caviar”. Studies show that even today many people, especially older people, get confused when asked to define vegan or vegetarian. Diet surveys have had to be amended because of the poor understanding of vegetarian and vegan. For instance, after surveys ask people if they are vegetarian or vegan, they then ask "When was the last time you ate chicken?" to try to make sure people mean what we usually ascribe to the word. Pol Pot doesn’t seem to have been vegetarian, so another blight on the meat eaters of the world it seems.</p>
<p>Finally Charles Manson, the Internet has failed me here. A lot of slightly unhinged websites gleefully assert he was and a couple of better-hinged ones as well, though none of them provide a shred of evidence. Still, although he hated hippies and thought they were weak, he dressed like one so maybe he ate like one. Will mark this one as inconclusive.</p>


<p>So what motivates the repetition of this claim about Hitler etc to people who don't eat meat? Some people seem to have a need to pre-emptively attack a vegan because they imagine being judged, almost like there is a conversation already in their head that a vegan unknowingly steps into. People want status, including moral status, but changing or earning it can be inconvenient, by for instance swapping a few ingredients in their diet. So they are left in an uncomfortable state, and this is what's called cognitive dissonance. To avoid change without having a troubled conscience they need to find intellectual justifications for any of their behaviours which they feel on some level to be morally questionable. So you get "Hitler was a bad person, Hitler was a vegetarian, vegetarians are bad people"; Aristotle wouldn't have thought much of this syllogism but any logic, even poor logic will do for a person seeking any available exit from a moral quandary.</p>


<p>It is also poor statistics, you can't make widespread inferences about a group of people from cherry-picked examples. Even if Hitler and Pol Pot actually were ethical vegetarians, what about Mao Tse Tung, Joseph Stalin, Talat Pasha, Suharto, Saddam Hussein, Atilla the Hun, Genghis Khan, Nero, Caligula, King Leopold, Idi Amin, Vlad the Impaler and of course the vast, vast majority of Nazis who were meat-eaters. But you don’t find vegans saying to carnists “Oh you eat meat, Donald Trump eats meat”. Even though it may be true, it doesn’t tell us much about the character of the person we are talking to. Many vegans didn’t start life as vegans, that they too ate meat, not because they were bad people but because they just hadn’t really considered the lives of other animals enough, or had the tools and mindset to do something about it.</p>


<p>Given the scale of animal suffering at human hands, the billions huddled in factory farms, their bodies altered to be production machines and the many wild species of the world in retreat or facing extinction, how can it be argued this is not a moral spot on which we need to shine some light? People should think carefully before engaging in knee-jerk reactions against people arguing for a better relationship between humans and non-humans. Even if you think they are wrong, is having compassion, maybe even too much compassion for other species more terrible than the problem it trying to bring attention to? This is not to say that vegans who lack empathy for people should get a free pass to be rude or inconsiderate. Veganism when properly understood is about compassion and consideration for all that can suffer, and this should include humans.</p>


<p>An ethical outlook that considers humans but not animals, or animals but not humans, is incomplete. An ethically and intellectually consistent life should have at its core compassion for all beings who can suffer, all earthlings who experience this and future moments in existence together. The word for this philosophy is veganism.</p>
