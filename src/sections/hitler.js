It is also perversely ironic to use people whose most evil acts involved killing to justify the unnecessary killing of animals. There is just no respect here for humans or other animals.</p>`;

<p>OK this is Vegan Bingo, and none of these people are claimed to be vegan, but we still hear this so let's go. We should first acknowledge that some evil people might have eaten some vegetables at some point in their lives. We also acknowledge the statistical likelihood that out of the many millions of people who've led vegetarian lives a certain number would have been bad people.</p>
<p>Tolstoy said vegetarianism is a sign someone's pursuit of moral perfection is sincere. I'd probably update that to veganism, and it sounds nice but not everyone gives up eating meat for ethical reasons. Health, religion, culture, digestion issues, allergies and to impress a hot vegan friend, are all pretty common. Most people are ethical in some areas but have moral blind-spots in others, so we need to know more about someone than one trait. Families in India have abstained from meat for centuries, but it's doubtful every single person they produced was some sort of Ghandian figure. Vegetarians, and vegans are flawed people too, most of are just trying to figure out this life and get a little better ethically we go along.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about Hitler. He ate meat until he was almost 50, by which time he had ruled Germany for years, was having people killed and put in concentration camps. He had long term stomach problems, and some say doctors put him on a vegetarian diet around 1937. If someone snuck meat into his food, and people seemed to have done this repeatedly right to the end, he would complain about it hurting his stomach. So how much this was really motivated by ethics is hard to tell. Hitler did show some concern for animals and the Nazis did enact laws against animal cruelty, but if people like the Nazis were just pure evil history would be a lot simpler. They also had social programmes and helped poor people, so they were incomprehensibly vile but not every single thing they did necessarily was.</p>
<p>On to Pol Pot and his murderous regime. This was relatively recent, the people who cooked for him are still alive, and they say he ate all sorts of things, fish, cobra, boar etc. An official who knew him seemed to say he was a vegetarian, but who knows what they were basing that on. As a byline we have to understand that many people get confused about what vegetarian means, especially in the past. Studies show that even today, many older people don't understand the term as well as younger people do when asked to define it. Surveys of diet have had to be amended because of the poor understanding of vegetarian and vegan. For instance, after they ask if people are vegetarian or vegan, they now ask questions like \\"When was the last time you ate chicken?\\" to try to make sure.</p>
<p>Finally Manson, the Internet has failed me here. A lot of slightly unhinged websites kind of gleefully say he was, a couple of less unhinged ones stating it without giving any evidence for it. Still although he hated hippies and thought they were weak, he dressed like one so maybe he ate like one. Will leave this one at inconclusive.</p>
<p>So what motivates the repetition of this claim about Hitler etc to people who don't eat meat? There seems to be a need to pre-emptively attack a vegan or vegetarian because they imagine being judged. People want moral status, but it can inconvenient to earn it, they might have to swap some ingredients in their diet for instance. So they are left in an uncomfortable state, and this is what's called cognitive dissonance. They don't want to change, but don't want to feel bad about having animals killed for them, so they need to to find intellectual justifications that how they already behave is a morally correct position. So you get \\"Hitler was a bad person, hitler was a vegetarian, vegetarians are bad people\\"; Aristotle wouldn't have thought much of that logic but it will do for someone looking for any available exit from a moral quandary.</p>
<p>It is also poor statistics, you can't make widespread inferences from cherry picked examples. Mao Tse Tung, Joseph Stalin, Talat Pasha, Suharto, Saddam Hussein, Atilla the Hun, Genghis Khan, Nero, Caligula, King Leopold, Idi Amin, Vlad the Impaler and of course most of the rest of the Nazis were meat eaters. So were lots of good people, but as we said most people have at least one moral blind spot.</p>
<p>Veganism is is a movement of millions it is bound to have some crazies and even killers, but when properly understood it is about compassion and consideration for all life, especially those intelligent, sensitive humans.</p>
