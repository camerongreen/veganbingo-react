These are all dubious or plainly wrong. Over human history we have mostly eaten plants, and can survive and thrive on them alone.</p>`;

<p>The amount of meat people eat, the prices they want to pay for it and the number of people eating it has lead directly to the modern industrial factory farm, one of the cruelest things humankind has ever created. A lot of people talk about humane farming as an alternative, but for all those that talk about it few people are supporting it consistently with their money. It's like the fantasy of humane factory farms and slaughterhouses somehow creeps into the real world and gives people a clear conscience about the treatment of farmed animals.</p>
<p>People say eating a vegan diet is difficult, which most vegans will say isn't true, but in any case trying to live as a so-called "compassionate carnivore" is much harder, which is why I've never met one who did it with any consistency. Some people might buy some more humane animal products to eat at home, but that's about the extent of the trouble they are willing to go to. Their ethics don't seem to apply to pre-made food products they purchase, which contain animal ingredients sourced with little consideration for their welfare. Their concern for ethically raised animals also doesn't seem to matter when out at restaurants or cafes, or when they are buying shoes, clothes and other products.</p>
<p>A vegan going to a restaurant or friends house can simply avoid animal products, whereas the compassionate carnivore has to go into almost historical detail about the products used, or eat vegan anyway if the choices available turn out to be from factory farms. They are also going to be out of pocket, as much of the cruelty involved in the animal farming system is to keep costs down. Vegans can turn to cheap legumes and beans, but people who want to eat more compassionately whilst continuing to eat animals multiple times a day are going to be spending a lot more of their income on food. Cheap meat means cruelty.</p>
<p>Backyard farming has emotional appeal but little else. The unregulated nature of it could lead to more painful deaths, lower standards of care and hidden abuse. Also, the modern factory farmed animal has not been bred with its welfare in mind. As an example, chickens in the wild lay maybe a couple of dozen eggs each year. The modern factory farmed chicken has been bred to lay one every day. This takes a terrible toll on their bodies, animal sanctuaries put them on hormones which slow this down to give them a chance to recover, but even this can't be done long term. Chickens will live up to 10 years naturally, but egg laying factory farmed chickens are killed at younger than two years old because their bodies simply can't take it. Most people aren't aware of the fact that these animals have been bred to be profit making machines when they decide to take on farmed animals at home.</p>
<p>If people care about the animals they are raising, maybe even treat them as part of the family as they do their pets, it would mean an improvement in animal welfare. Of course the average home would need hundreds of animals to sustain the current levels of slaughter, hardly possible in the apartments billions of people live in. Keeping an animal captive and prematurely killing it is undoubtedly a form of oppression, but even oppression exists on a scale and many of these animals would be better off under such a system.</p>
<p>If people really caring about animals and want to experience them, they can house rescued animals from factory farms, pay for good veterinary care and let them live out their lives in relative freedom.</p>
