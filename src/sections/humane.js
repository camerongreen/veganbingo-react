const short_answer = `<p>As much as any factory-farmed animal, chickens have been bred as production machines. Even if you treat them as a pet and don’t kill them early, a hen from a factory farm will lay hundreds of large eggs a year which is not consistent with their health or quality of life. If on the other hand you get a more traditional breed the industry would call a “poor” egg layer (which still means many times more eggs for their bodies to produce than their wild counterparts) it will obviously mean a better life for the chicken than one on a factory farm. You could also just leave chickens alone and eat something else, and maybe give your love to a different, preferably vegetarian pet.</p>`;

<p>The sheer amount of meat people eat, the prices they want to pay and the number of people eating it has led directly to the industrial factory farm, one of the cruellest inventions of humankind. To meaningfully reduce the suffering of animals in farms, not to mention the vast environmental footprint of animal agriculture, people will have to be far more conscious about what they eat, eat far fewer animals and pay far more for their bodies and secretions. People talk about more humane farms as a “drop-in” alternative, but they simply can’t hope to approach the scale of the huge international conglomerates who profit from animal suffering.</p>


<p>For all that talk about more humane animal farming, few consumers are at all consistent in buying their products. Why people who eat meat so regularly bring up the discussion of humane farming, which they don’t want to pay for, remains a mystery. It's like their fantasies about humane animal farming creep into the real world just enough to absolve their conscience about what is actually going on in the factory farms they are making more profitable at every meal they eat involving animal products. There are many things we could do and many fantasies we can have but surely it is what we do in the real world that counts morally.</p>


<p>Backyard farming has emotional appeal, it tries to replicate the stories we tell children about how animals are farmed. Mother hens clucking happily with their chicks under their wings, a rooster crowing to greet the sunrise on a fence in the background. The same stories are often replicated on the outside of the packaging of animal products, the happy piglet on some grass, the smiling cow with a flower in its mouth, her calf by her side. Inside the packaging however is the dismembered corpse of these animals, prematurely slaughtered and often having only ever glimpsed the sun between bars or in the truck on the way to the slaughterhouse. Roosters of course rarely get even that far, suffocated in bags, or ground up alive soon after being born, because they are of no use to the industry. Pigs, cows, large fish, none of these fit into the backyard farmer ideal, but then backyard farming is more about bucolic fantasies than any serious solution to the widespread suffering of farm animals.</p>


<p>So back to the poor chicken, perhaps the most abused animal in the world. Two-thirds of the total bird mass in the world are chickens on factory farms. If you are thinking of re-homing an animal from a factory farm that would otherwise go to slaughter, whilst a noble idea, it comes with various health and sometimes mental issues for the birds. The modern factory-farmed hen has not been bred with its welfare in mind, it has been bred by large corporations to make profit. Wild chickens laid one or two dozen eggs split into two clutches each year. The modern factory-farmed chicken has been bred to lay a large egg every day. This takes a terrible toll on their small bodies, leaching calcium and other vital nutrients. Animal sanctuaries that take in hens from factory farms often put them on hormones to slow down egg production and give their bodies a chance to heal, though this isn’t a healthy long-term solution either. Chickens will live up to 10 years naturally, but egg-laying factory-farmed chickens are killed at younger than two years old because to use industry jargon reminiscent of machines "their production falls rapidly" at this stage, in other words, their reproductive systems and bodies are spent. The brothers of these egg-laying hens are killed as chicks, generally by grinding up alive or suffocating/gassing. Note these are the recommended “more humane” ways of killing male chicks as opposed to letting them slowly die of dehydration in garbage bins, even though this is a perfectly legal method. Animal welfare standards often have specific exceptions for factory farms, so the profits can flow.</p>


<p>In backyard farming there is still the problem with too many male birds, so they are usually grown until they start to mature, from 3 to 4 months, and are then slaughtered to eat. Female birds will live long after their egg-laying starts to slow down, and are also generally slaughtered by backyard farmers as this starts to happen. So backyard farming can alleviate the intense confinement and cages, but not the slaughter and much of the physical suffering. Whether any of this is ethically acceptable just depends on how much we really need eggs, or can we just eat something else?</p>


<p>Factory farms and slaughterhouses are terrible places, and that is even with some oversight by the government and the occasional activist breaking in and documenting conditions in them. The unregulated, unseen nature of backyard farming can lead to more painful deaths, neglect, lower standards of care and hidden abuse. Suffering does exist on a scale, however. If we make assumptions that people would care more about the animals if they raised them then it should mean on average an improvement in their welfare.</p>


<p>Backyard farming cannot make much of a dent in the factory farming system for meat production though while people continue to consume as they do. The average home would need hundreds of animals to sustain the current levels of slaughter, hardly possible in the suburban houses and apartments today’s urbanised populations live in. The historically unprecedented amount of animal products wealthy humans eat can only be fed by the industrial factory farm. There are also all the animal products already in products people buy, the food they purchase at restaurants and cafes, and the meals they have with friends, family and colleagues. Monitoring all of this to ensure it is ethically produced gets so complicated, if you want to live more ethically it is far simpler to just go vegan.</p>


<p>Taking a sentient being's freedom away, using its body for profit and production, and prematurely killing them will always be a form of oppression. If this were all humans were capable of surviving on, if we really needed these products to be healthy then maybe kinder oppression would be the best relationship with non-human animals we could hope for. That many millions of people have gone vegan and are living happy, healthy lives says otherwise. If we care about the non-human animals of the world and are willing to make personal changes, perhaps checking out the thousands of articles, videos, kits and other free resources showing you how to be a healthy vegan is the best place to start.</p>


<p>Another world is possible in the relationship between humans and non-humans. Be part of that change. After all, animals are not on this earth for us, they are here with us.</p>
