const short_answer = `<p>As much as any factory-farmed animal, chickens have been bred as production machines. A hen from a factory farm has been selectively bred to lay hundreds of large eggs yearly. This torturous regime is not consistent with their health or quality of life. Life as a pet in your backyard might be better, at least for a while, than life on a factory farm but their bodies have been bred to suffer. In the long term if you care about the lives of chickens, perhaps eat something else.</p>`;

<p>The sheer quantity of meat people consume and the relentless push to make it cheaper have led directly to the industrial factory farm, one of the cruellest creations of humankind. To meaningfully reduce the suffering of animals on farms, not to mention the vast environmental footprint of animal agriculture, people would have to consume very differently than how they do now. They would need to be far more conscious about what animal products they eat, eat much less and pay far more. People also don’t want to change so they fantasise about magical fixes but don’t think them through. People talk about more humane farms as a “drop-in” alternative, but they simply can’t hope to approach the scale of the huge international conglomerates that profit from churning out animal parts and secretions into the human food chain.</p>


<p>For all that talk about more humane animal farming, few consumers are at all consistent in buying their products. Why people who eat meat regularly bring up the discussion of humane farming, which they don’t seem to want to pay for, remains a mystery. It's like their fantasies about humane animal farming creep into the real world just enough to absolve their conscience about what is actually going on in the cruel factory farms they pay to exist at every meat-based meal. There are many fantasies we can have but surely it is what we do in the real world where animals daily suffer and die for our food that counts morally.</p>


<p>Backyard farming has emotional appeal, it tries to replicate the stories we tell children about how animals are farmed. Mother hens clucking happily with their chicks under their wings, a rooster on a fence crowing to greet the sunrise, the happy piglet on some grass, the smiling cow with a flower in its mouth, her calf by her side. These fairy tales are often replicated on the outside of the packaging of animal products. Inside the packaging however is the reality of a dismembered animal, a corpse that during its unnaturally short life experienced unnecessary suffering, and was then sent to a slaughterhouse. Many of them have never known family, or been able to express their natural behaviours, or have seen the sun except when crammed together as they are being transported to their death. Pigs, cows, roosters, large fish, none of these fit into the backyard farmer ideal, but then backyard farming is more about bucolic fantasies than any serious solution to the widespread suffering of farm animals.</p>


<p>So back to the poor chicken, the most widely abused animal in the world. If you ever wonder about the scale of factory farming, think about the fact that two-thirds of the total bird mass in the world are chickens on factory farms. If you are thinking of rehoming an animal from a factory farm that would otherwise go to slaughter, whilst a noble idea, it comes with various health and often mental issues for the birds. The modern factory-farmed hen has not been bred with its welfare in mind, it has been bred by corporations to make profit. Wild chickens lay one or two dozen eggs split into two clutches each year. The modern factory-farmed chicken has been bred to lay 10-15 times this amount, averaging a large egg every day. This takes a terrible toll on the small bodies of hens, leaching calcium and other vital nutrients from them. Animal sanctuaries that take in hens from factory farms often put them on hormones to slow down egg production and give their bodies a chance to heal, though this isn’t a healthy long-term solution either. Chickens will live up to 10 years naturally, but egg-laying factory-farmed chickens are killed at younger than two years old because to use industry jargon reminiscent of machines "their production falls rapidly" at this stage, in other words, their reproductive systems and bodies are spent. The brothers of these egg-laying hens are worthless to the industry so are killed as chicks, generally by grinding up alive or suffocating/gassing. Note these are the recommended “more humane” ways of killing male chicks as opposed to the common practise of letting them slowly die of dehydration in garbage bins. You might wonder how this sort of cruelty can be legal. Animal welfare standards often have specific exceptions for factory farms, so corporate profits can flow and consumers can get ever cheaper food.</p>


<p>In backyard farming there is still the problem with too many male birds, Roosters are noisy, fight and don’t lay eggs, so they are slaughtered for food at 3 to 4 months, just before they start to mature. Female birds will live long after their egg-laying ceases but are also generally slaughtered by backyard farmers as their reproductive systems start to slow down. So while backyard farming does alleviate the intense confinement and cages, it still involves slaughter and often much of the physical suffering. Whether any of this is ethically acceptable partly depends on how much human nutrition is really dependent on eggs.</p>


<p>Factory farms and slaughterhouses are terrible places, and that is even with some oversight by the government and the occasional activist breaking in and documenting conditions in them. The unregulated, unseen nature of backyard farming can lead to more painful deaths, neglect, untreated disease, lower standards of care and hidden abuse. Suffering does exist on a scale, however, so if we make the perhaps tenuous assumption that people will treat their backyard animals like pets then it would mean on average an improvement in their welfare.</p>


<p>Backyard farming cannot make much of a dent in the factory farming system for meat production though while people continue to consume as they do. The average home would need hundreds of animals to sustain the current levels of slaughter, hardly possible in the small suburban yards and apartments today’s urbanised populations live in. The historically unprecedented amount of animal products wealthy humans eat can only be fed by the industrial factory farm. There are also all the animal products already in packaged food people buy, the food they purchase at restaurants and cafes, and the meals they have with friends, family and colleagues. Monitoring all of this to ensure it is ethically produced gets complicated, there are going to be long discussions with waiters and people whose homes you are eating at. If you want to live more ethically, it is not only far more effective, but also far simpler to just go vegan.</p>


<p>When talking about ethics, practicalities are relevant but not the core of the story. Taking a sentient being's freedom away, using its body for profit and production, disrupting their lives and families, and prematurely killing them will always be a form of oppression. That we can use animals for our own ends is a clear symbol of human might or human supremacy, but what does this say about human ethics? We know non-human animals suffer, regardless of whether they think about their suffering from the same level we do, or can write an excruciating poem about it later. The truth that confronts us is simple, animals suffer and we can dramatically reduce that suffering by changing our diets.</p>


<p>Habit can blind us to our agency, that we are making choices, ones that are consequential for other sentient lives. Through our daily consumption choices, at restaurants and supermarkets, we directly affect animals, whether they experience more or less pain. We impact the lives of others for better or worse even if we aren’t aware of it because we never see or interact with them. Veganism is part of engaging with this wider ethical reality, of a hope that humans can transcend being a narcissistic and oppressive species.</p>


<p>We can do better than moving the slaughter of animals to our backyards and instead extend to them the possibility of the life and freedom that all beings crave, that we consider our own right. That growing millions have gone vegan and are living happy, healthy lives points to a brighter shared future between human and non-human beings. The logical extent of humane farming is vegan farming, why would we want to become invested in some half-measure along the way?</p>
