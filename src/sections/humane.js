const short_answer = `<p>On average a chicken in the backyard of a caring family is going to have a better life than one in a factory farm. Like other factory farmed animals though, they have been bred as production machines, not for their welfare. A small bird just can't lay hundreds of eggs a year and be healthy.</p>`;

<p>The amount of meat people eat, the prices they want to pay for it and the number of people eating it has lead directly to the industrial factory farm, one of the cruelest inventions of humankind. People talk about more humane farms as an alternative, but for all that talk few people are consistent in supporting them. Why they bring them up all the time then remains a mystery. It's like the fantasy of humane animal farming somehow creeps into the real world just enough to give people a clean conscience about their eating of factory farmed animals.</p>
<p>Backyard farming has emotional appeal, it tries to replicate the stories we tell children about how animals are farmed. The same stories are often replicated on the outside of the packaging of animal products, the happy pig on some grass, smiling in the sunshine, whilst inside the package is the corpse of a prematurely slaughtered animal that lived its life on concrete floors and only ever glimpsed the sun between bars. Pigs, cows, large fish, none of these fit into the backyard city farmer ideal, but few people advocating backyard chickens are seriously talking about it as a solution to most forms of animal exploitation.</p>
<p>So back to the poor chicken, one of the most abused animals on earth. If you are thinking of re-homing an animal from a factory farm, whilst a noble thing to do, it comes with various health issues for the birds. The modern factory farmed hen has not been bred with its welfare in mind, it has been bred by corporations as a money making machine. Chickens in the wild lay one or two dozen eggs, split into two clutches, each year. The modern factory farmed chicken has been bred to lay one every day. This takes a terrible toll on their small bodies, leeching calcium and other vital nutrients. Animal sanctuaries that take in hens from factory farms often put them on hormones to slow down egg production and give their bodies a chance to heal. Chickens will live up to 10 years naturally, but egg laying factory farmed chickens are killed at younger than two years old because to use industry jargon "their production falls rapidly" at this stage, in other words their reproductive systems and bodies are spent. The brothers of these egg laying hens have all been killed as chicks, generally by grinding up alive or suffocating/gassing. In backyard farming, male birds are usually grown until they start to mature, from 3 to 4 months, and are then slaughtered. Female birds will live long after their egg laying starts to slow down, and are also generally slaughtered.</p>
<p>Factory farms and slaughterhouses are terrible places, and that is even with some oversight by government and the occasional activist breaking in and documenting conditions in them. The unregulated, unseen nature of backyard farming could lead to more painful deaths, lower standards of care and hidden abuse.</p>
<p>Suffering does exist on a scale however. If we make assumptions that people would care more about the animals if they raised them, maybe even treat them as part of the family as they often do their pets, it would mean an improvement in animal welfare. It is never going to make much of a dent in the factory farm system though. The average home would need hundreds of animals to sustain the current levels of slaughter, hardly possible in the suburban houses and apartments billions of people live in. The historically unprecedented amount of meat wealthy humans eat, can only be fed by the industrial factory farm.</p>
<p>Taking a sentient being's freedom, using it for production and prematurely killing will always be a form of oppression. If this were all humans were capable of, if we really needed these products to survive and be happy, then maybe kinder oppression would be the best relationship with non-human animals we could hope for. Many millions of people who have gone vegan say otherwise. After all the animals of the world are here with us, not for us.</p>
