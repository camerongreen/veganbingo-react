const short_answer = `<p>There is too much suffering in the world. Think of all the terrible things that happen in nature, the terrible things beings have done to each other down through the centuries. Are they something we should continue because we might be able to call them natural, perpetuating the sometimes brutal potential of our universe? Or would the world be a better place if we tried to move beyond them? We should not chain ourselves to the past. Whether something has been done for a long time or could be called natural is irrelevant to whether it is necessary, just or compassionate.</p>`;

<p>As much as humans have long wished for an ordered, moral universe, one that makes sense, the laws which govern the universe we actually have are mathematical and amoral. Good things happen to bad people, bad things happen to good people, all governed by the elegant but soulless laws of physics. We made up things like karma, heaven and hell to shield ourselves from the unpalatable truth that the control we have over our lives and fate is limited. Hard work, intelligence and diligence are all potent factors in deciding what sort of life we will have, but luck is the card that can come in and overrule them all. It would be nice if the universe had some sort of innate justice, so long as we agreed with the laws governing that justice, but it does not.</p>
<p>Science and philosophy have long known this, and hence there is something called “The naturalistic fallacy”. To say something is natural and consider this a moral or intellectual defence of it is not enough. Massive outbreaks of deadly diseases used to be common; to intervene with modern medicine is not necessarily natural, but it is surely the most moral action available. Cannibalism, slavery, warfare, oppression and all manner of atrocities have long and common histories in human society. We could claim they are natural but if so is that any valid ethical defence of them? Should a murderer be able to use the defence in a court of law “But people have always murdered each other”? If not then why should this be applied to every other member of the animal kingdom?</p>
<p>We make advances in society in fields such as law, justice, democracy, modern medicine and philosophy not by appeals to what is natural but what is right. The ethics of our treatment of animals should not be any different. If we can be healthy by eating a diet that doesn't oppress billions of other creatures, should we continue their oppression because we have labelled it natural? Is the fact that we have always treated animals badly any valid excuse for foregoing moral progress?</p>
<p>A respect for nature is obviously a good and important thing, especially given the limits of our knowledge, and our poor history of intervening in natural systems. But to call the modern diet "natural", or the factory farming system "natural" is to render the word meaningless. It is almost a cold joke to call it natural when one of the primary drivers of the destruction of the natural world is the modern animal farming system. People who only eat wild animals they have hunted with their own hands might be able to make the claim that they are doing something natural, but that sort of system is never going to feed billions of people meat twice a day. The way we eat meat requires an unnatural system. We have turned our back on the wild which we fear, long ago breaking the food chain and jettisoning our place in any sort of cycle consistent with the evolutionary system. The unnatural, destructive animal confinement system of barbed wire, cages and slaughterhouses, the pasture which covers huge swathes of our planet is one of the first things we need to transcend if our species wants to reclaim any sort of positive, compatible relationship with the natural world.</p>
<p>Some things are both natural and good, such as the freedom and joy that every sentient being desires. Taking that from them needlessly, when we have such abundance, when we can choose to eat a thousand different things, needs a better justification than that it is a habit we don’t care enough to change.</p>
<p>Killing, death, whatever evils there are in nature, in being human we have some power to reduce them. Pointing to the natural world to justify our actions is a denial of agency and personal responsibility. We could have a very different relationship with the natural world and bring healing to it, making it a kinder place for more beings. We can have a reverence for the evolutionary systems of life without using them as an excuse to ignore our selfishness and moral failings, for our limited circle of compassion. We create some part of the world by each act of living, the question which then confronts our conscience is what sort of world are we using our life energy to contribute to?
