const short_answer = `<p>Whether something has been done for a long time or could be called natural is irrelevant to whether it is necessary, just or compassionate. Think of all the terrible things that have happened down through the centuries, the murder and violence. Should things be perpetuated just because they were a regular feature in an amoral universe, or should we use our human agency to recognise injustice and move beyond it?  Intellectual and ethical progress requires that we not chain ourselves to the suffering of the past, calling it natural doesn’t change this truth.</p>`;

<p>As much as humans have long wished for an ordered, moral universe, one that makes sense, the laws which govern the universe we actually have are mathematical and amoral. Good things happen to bad people, bad things happen to good people, all governed by the elegant but soulless laws of physics. Humanity made up things like karma, heaven and hell to give us the impression of a just universe in order to shield ourselves from the unpalatable truth that the control we have over our lives and fate is limited. Hard work, intelligence and diligence are all potent factors in deciding what sort of life we will have, but blind luck often comes in and overrules them all. It would be nice if the universe had some sort of innate justice, but it does not.</p>


<p>Science and philosophy have long known that what happens in nature is not necessarily right or just, and hence there is something called “The naturalistic fallacy”. To say something is natural and consider this a moral or intellectual defence of it is not enough. Massive outbreaks of deadly diseases used to be common; to intervene with modern medicine is not necessarily natural, but it is surely the most moral action available. Cannibalism, slavery, warfare, patriarchy, oppression and all manner of atrocities have long and fairly universal histories in human society. We could claim they are natural but if so is that a valid ethical defence of them? Should a murderer be able to use the defence in a court of law “But people have always murdered each other, what I did was natural”? If this doesn’t apply to murdering humans then should it apply to other members of the animal kingdom? Vegans don’t think we absolve our part in causing suffering by the fact that it is done by lots of people or has been done for a long time. Restated: Causing unnecessary suffering to sentient creatures requires a higher ethical justification than conformity or habit.</p>


<p>Part of the higher meaning of our societies is that we progress together. We make advances in society in fields such as law, justice, democracy, modern medicine and philosophy, and we do so not by appeals primarily of what is natural or has always been done but by establishing what is best and most just. The ethics of our treatment of animals are not and should not be any different. We can flourish eating a diet that doesn't breed, imprison and slaughter billions of creatures, so why should we continue their oppression? Is the fact that we have always treated animals badly any valid excuse for foregoing moral progress?</p>


<p>A respect for nature is obviously a good and important thing, especially given the limits of our knowledge, and our poor history of intervening in natural systems but even if eating animals is natural, to call the modern diet "natural", or the factory farming system "natural" is to render the word meaningless. It is almost a cold joke to call it natural when one of the primary drivers of the destruction of the natural world is the modern animal farming system. People who hunt wild animals with tools they made, might be able to make the claim that they are doing something natural, but that sort of system is never going to feed billions of people meat multiple times a day or week. The way we eat meat requires an unnatural system. We have turned our back on the wild which we fear, long ago breaking the food chain and jettisoning our place in any sort of cycle consistent with the evolutionary system. The unnatural, oppressive animal confinement system of barbed wire, cages and slaughterhouses, the pasture which destructively covers huge swathes of our planet is one of the first things we need to transcend if our species wants to reclaim any sort of positive, compatible relationship with the natural world.</p>


<p>Our higher consciousness gives us power and therefore potential responsibility. Killing, death, disease, whatever evils there are in nature as human beings we can reflect on them and potentially to reduce them. There are more positive ways humans generally could interact with the non-human world, we could bring healing to it, lessen the impact of disease and disaster, make it a kinder place to exist for more beings. For other animals, we could almost be like the benevolent gods we have always imagined. We can build our philosophies on a reverence for the evolutionary systems of life without using them as an excuse for limiting our circle of compassion.</p>


<p>Nature can be beautiful and awe-inspiring, but nature can also be cruel and arbitrary, we cannot wave away the ethics of what we do by simple appeals to it. Living an ethical life asks more of us intellectually than conformity or habit, instead, it bids us return often to first principles, to rethink and deepen what we know and believe and where necessary change the actions that flow from those beliefs. Just by the fact of our existence as human beings, we are powerful potential actors in a plane of sentient experience in which there is much good to be done. To be or not be, to act or not act, every choice has ethical consequences, we have only to choose “what sort of reality will my life energy help create?”. If the universe is to be more just, including for other animals, the only certain hope comes from us, the actions and ethical progress of individual humans. This hope lies in our thoughts, actions and potential. We have the freedom to be different, to transcend nature, and to reduce suffering. Our ethical challenge, perhaps the meaning of our collective and individual lives, is to make the world a kinder and more beautiful place to be.</p>


<p>These are lofty goals, that ask much of us, they are perhaps unattainable in their fullest expression. This is as it should be, we need a challenge worthy of our higher consciousness, that calls us to fulfil our potential. Being natural for our species is perhaps no longer possible, desirable or ethical, so let us enter into the conversation about what world we will collectively help create, not just for humanity but for all of life. There are relatively simple, powerful actions we can take to begin. By our daily consumption, we can vote against the unbalancing of nature and oppression. Veganism is a starting point for a new conception of humanity’s place in this complex world, for the shared destiny of the grand family of beings evolving together upon it. </p>
