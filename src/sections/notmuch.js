const short_answer = `<p>When someone says "I don't eat much meat", what vegans hear is "I don't eat many animals". It's better than the alternative of eating more animals, but our hearts and thoughts are with the animals in the factory farms and slaughterhouses. So forgive us if we don't seem as happy as people would like about this statement, but it is good that they are trying, it's a positive step and hopefully we'll see them on the vegan side one day.</p>`;

<p>This is a positive statement, the only problem is that too often those who say this aren't 100% in touch with reality. People say this that eat meat every day, often for lunch and dinner, sometimes even breakfast. Perhaps it means they eat more chicken and fish than they used to, or perhaps they are having smaller portions. If this is true it is better on many levels, health, environmental, animal suffering, than whatever diet they previously followed, but they are still probably eating lots of animals.</p>
<p>Not eating a lot of meat doesn't equate to eating less animals. Chickens, some of the most abused animals in the farming system, are tiny compared to a cow or pig. That's why there are so many billions of them living terrible lives in factory farms. The treatment of fish, who range in size but are often small, is exemplified by the fact that they aren't even counted, just measured in tonnes. There is no regard for them as sentient individuals, people still often think that they don't feel pain, which goes against not just science but common sense. Switching your diet from large animals to smaller animals means more animals in factory farms, crushed in nets, suffocated, impaled with hooks or harried into slaughterhouses.</p>
<p>So the healthy diet, or the more environmentally friendly diet, often comes at the cost of more animals suffering. Which is why vegans don't do a little song and dance when you say that you don't eat much meat to us. There's also the whole dairy industry, which is an environmental and animal suffering disaster.  That's why people who care about animals don't just swap beef for chicken or more cheese, they swap them with beans, tofu, seitan, nuts, seeds, lentils and commercial plant based alternatives.</p>
<p>Our ideas of what a normal diet is are culturally shaped. Most people predominantly eat the way their parents did, for no better reason than that's what their parents did. The fact that someone eats less meat than their parents, relative or friend, or chooses white meats instead of red meat, does not equate to not eating much meat. Average meat consumption is still very high according to most peak dietary bodies, which is why they consistently encourage people to reduce their meat consumption. Those same peak dietary bodies also point out that you can be just as healthy on vegan diets as any other well planned diet. So there is no need to eat meat in any amount, it is a choice, a choice we can change if we want to tread more lightly on the flora and fauna of our world.</p>
<p>OK so we want to acknowledge some people really don't eat much meat. If someone has many more days without meat than otherwise, only cook vegan at home, or only eat meat at occasional social gatherings, then they might be able to claim to be not eating much meat. To everyone else saying this, we want to acknowledge that you are making personal progress, but we can't help noticing you still eat a lot of animals, and we aren't quite ready to roll out the red carpet for you yet.</p>
<p>For the animals who live and die in agribusiness systems before ending up in packaging, are bred to be a product that someone uses with no more thought to it than any other product, for the environment suffering from deforestation, water and air pollution, for the wild animals of the world whose ecosystems and communities are under constant pressure, for the communities at risk of hunger whose grain is instead sent to feed animals for the wealthy of the world, the optimal amount of animals for us to eat will always be zero.</p>
