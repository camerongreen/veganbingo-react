const short_answer = `<p>When someone says "I don't eat much meat", vegans can’t help but translate that to "I don't kill many animals". We recognise it's better than the alternatives, but a vegan mind travels unbidden to the reality hidden beneath such statements; animals huddled in factory farms or being marched through slaughterhouses. Most vegans appreciate someone trying to make positive changes, but words which have victims are hard to get excited about.</p>`;

<p>That someone is reducing their meat consumption, or has switched to plant-based milk is positive on many levels. Reducing animal products in our diets has positive ramifications for our health, environmental footprint and contribution to animal suffering. Unfortunately, people who say they don’t each much meat often seem to eat meat daily at lunch and dinner, sometimes even breakfast. If they have something without meat they don’t give the animals a break because it usually involves eggs or dairy. Perhaps people are eating smaller portions, have swapped red meat for chicken and fish, or feel they eat less meat than the people around them. To a vegan, it still seems like quite a lot of animal products. For all the aspirational talk of meat reduction in developed countries and surveys that say majorities of people want to eat fewer animal products, we aren’t yet seeing this reflected in fewer animals going to slaughter.</p>


<p>Perhaps unintuitively not eating a lot of meat doesn’t mean eating fewer animals; it depends on who you eat. Chickens, some of the most abused animals in the farming system, are tiny in size relative to pigs or cows. Each person regularly eating chicken flesh and eggs means a sizeable flock suffering in factory farms and then channelled into slaughterhouses every year. This is why tens of billions of hens are currently imprisoned in terrible conditions around the globe, if you are eating them you are directly responsible for some portion of that. Fish is a regular substitute for people concerned about the health of their diet, but they are also often small in size, especially shellfish and crustaceans, so people who eat a diet heavy in them will also eat more animals. It’s not just the sea creatures on your plate you kill either, most industrial fishing methods are so indiscriminate that up to half of the death happens simply as bycatch, wild sentient creatures suffering and dying just to be tossed away as refuse. If meat reduction means switching your diet from pigs and cattle to chickens and fish, this will mean more animals in factory farms, crushed in nets, impaled with hooks, suffocated, and harried into slaughterhouses on your behalf. You may call it ”not eating much meat”, but it probably means you are killing more animals.</p>


<p>People consider dairy or eggs to be “deathless” industries, yet another sign of how divorced people have become from the reality of the animals they affect via their consumption. Male chickens are killed soon after their gender is detected, often dropped alive into grinders. Their sisters go on to spend a life of suffering before being killed when their reproductive systems are spent. Dairy cows are repeatedly impregnated to keep milk production high, with most male calves taken and killed for veal. “Humane” farms let the male calves live longer before slaughtering them, maybe a few months. Other farms castrate them without anaesthetic and grow them for a year or two before being slaughtered for low-grade meat production. The females in the dairy industry also end up at the slaughterhouse as well as soon as their milk production slows. The dairy industry is a vast environmental and animal welfare disaster. If you are serious about contributing to a better world with your diet, swapping meat for eggs or cheese might mean fewer animals suffering, but it is arguable that those animals would suffer more.</p>


<p>The case for globally dramatically reducing our dependence on animal products is pretty unassailable. Average meat consumption in developed countries is too high according to peak dietary bodies which consistently encourage people to reduce their meat consumption and instead eat more fruits, vegetables, beans etc. Studies show if people actually followed the diets peak nutritional bodies recommend, it would correlate to a major reduction of animal and environmental harm. We can do a lot of good for ourselves and the world by eating a healthy diet. Most peak dietary bodies also confirm that a well-planned vegan diet is as healthy as any other. There is no physiological necessity to eat meat, people do it out of habit, a habit we must replace if we want to tread lightly on the earth.</p>


<p>If we had to guess what someone eats, the best evidence we could use in doing so would be to look at what their parents ate. We don’t put much thought into how we came to eat what or who we do, but over our lives, we have been taught a specific cultural, somewhat arbitrary way of eating. We have learned a taste for particular things, become accustomed to a certain level of salt, sugar and fat in our foods, and learned what foods we consider appropriate at certain times of the day, but our diet is largely the arbitrary construction of psychological associations around the very basic need to get nutrients into our bodies. We can see all the cultures around the world happily eating very differently from each other, and if they were asked to eat the way another culture does they would find it strange and confusing. This is empowering in our food choices because while there might be a transition in learning a new way of eating, soon it would just become how we eat. Like many people who have made positive changes in their lives, we might wonder how and why we clung to our old lifestyles for so long.</p>


<p>One thing that is often unacknowledged is how much cultural diets have changed, especially during the latter twentieth century which saw the rise of industrialised factory farming and technologies like preservatives and refrigeration. People claim that particular cultures are and have always been particularly heavy meat consumers, but when we look at the average diet in those countries, only a few decades ago they were generally eating less than a third to a quarter of the meat per capita they do today. Meat was even more of a luxury product then than it is now, which is why many of the diseases common in wealthier societies today relating to having a bad diet, first displayed themselves in the wealthy of past ages who were the only ones who could afford to eat meat-heavy diets full of sugar and refined grains. If you compare yourself to the people around you right now it might be true to say you don’t eat much meat, but comparing your diet to the diet recommended by nutritional organisations, the diet in other cultures or the diet of your great-great-grandparents it might not be so true.</p>


<p>We should acknowledge people are often sincere in trying to eat more thoughtfully and reducing their meat consumption. If someone has more days without meat than otherwise, eats meat at occasional social gatherings, always chooses a vegetarian option when it’s available, or only eats meat that would otherwise go to waste, they can claim to be not eating much meat. To everyone else saying “I don’t eat much meat” who hasn’t kicked the daily, largely thoughtless consumption of meat, whilst acknowledging the positive aspiration, for the animals and environment we hope you can do better.</p>


<p>Eating an animal product is not an ethically neutral action, because it is an action with victims. Those victims may be kept out of sight and out of mind, but their suffering is very real. The price animals and the world pay for the industrial factory farming system is incredibly high. If we wish to live ethically we must bring to mind the sentient beings who live and die in this system, their dismembered bodies wrapped in plastic, used and discarded with no more thought than any other lifeless product; the shared living systems of our world in decline, suffering from deforestation, water, air and chemical pollution; the wild animals, under ever-growing existential pressure largely from the land used for animal pasture and feed; the poor communities who must compete for grain with the animals the wealthy consume as a luxury product.</p>


<p>Moving our culture to a better relationship with the earth requires changes in billions of individual lives. For many of us that change will be gradual, our actions lagging behind our ethical ideals. Taking time is understandable whilst new habits are acquired and until new ways of eating and thinking become embodied in our lives. Not eating much meat is positive, or at least less bad, but we should have higher ideals for ourselves and our contribution to the world. A better collective future awaits humans and animals beyond the factory farms, barbed wire and slaughterhouses, and that world is too important for us to tarry long in the purgatory of transitional phases.</p>
