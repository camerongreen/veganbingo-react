const short_answer = `<p>When someone says "I don't eat much meat", vegans can’t help hearing "I don't kill many animals". It's better than the alternative of course, but we think about the animals in the factory farms and slaughterhouses hidden beneath such a statement.

<p>This is a positive statement, actually not eating much meat can be better on many levels, health, environmental and animal suffering, than the standard meat-centric diet. The only problem is that too often those who say this aren't 100% in touch with reality. They often eat meat every day, for lunch and dinner, regularly adding bacon to breakfast, if they have something without meat it usually involves eggs or dairy products. Perhaps they eat more chicken and fish than they used to, or perhaps they are having smaller portions, it’s hard to tell, but it still often equates to a lot of meat.</p>
<p>Not eating a lot of meat paradoxically doesn’t mean eating fewer animals, depending on what, or who, you are eating. Chickens, some of the most abused animals in the farming system, are tiny relative to a cow or pig. That's why so many billions of them are living terrible lives in factory farms. The treatment of fish, who range in size but are often small, is exemplified by the fact that they aren't even counted, just measured in tonnes. Someone can eat many smaller fish in one sitting. There is no regard for them as sentient individuals, people misguidedly think that they don't feel pain, despite what modern science says about the question. If not eating much meat means switching your diet from large animals to smaller animals, it also means more animals in factory farms, crushed in nets, suffocated, impaled with hooks or harried into slaughterhouses.</p>
<p>Someone saying they are eating a healthier diet, or the more environmentally friendly diet, by switching to chickens means more animals suffering. This is why vegans might not be as excited as you hoped for when you tell us you don't eat much meat. There's also the whole dairy industry, which is an environmental and animal-suffering disaster on par with the rest of the industry. People who care about animals or the planet can't just swap beef for chicken or more cheese, but should swap them with beans, tofu, seitan, nuts, seeds, lentils and with the growing number of plant-derived alternatives.</p>
<p>Our ideas of what a normal diet is are culturally shaped. Most people predominantly eat the way their parents did, for no better reason than that's what their parents did. The fact that someone eats less meat than their parents, relative or friend, or chooses white meats instead of red meat, is a relative, not an absolute statistic. Average meat consumption is still very high according to most peak dietary bodies, which is why they consistently encourage people to reduce their meat consumption, to eat more fruits, vegetables, beans etc. Those same peak dietary bodies also point out that you can be just as healthy following a vegan diet as any other well-planned diet. There is no physiological need to eat meat, it is a choice, one we can change if we want to tread more lightly on the world.</p>
<p>OK so we want to acknowledge some people really don't eat much meat. If someone has many more days without meat than otherwise, or only eats meat at occasional social gatherings, then they might be able to claim to be not eating much meat. To everyone else saying this, we want to acknowledge that you are making personal progress, but we can't help noticing you still eat a lot of animals, and we aren't quite ready to roll out the red carpet for you.</p>
<p>For the animals who live and die in agribusiness systems before ending up in packaging, bred to be a product that someone uses and discards with no more thought to it than any other product; for our collective ecosystems suffering from deforestation, water and air pollution; for the wild animals of the world who are under constant existential pressure from the land wasted on animal farming; for poor communities whose grain is sent to feed animals the wealthy consume; the optimal amount of animals we need to eat is none.</p>
