const short_answer = `<p>When someone says "I don't eat much meat", vegans can’t help translating that to "I don't kill many animals". It's better than the alternative, but our minds go unbidden to the animals in the factory farms and slaughterhouses hidden beneath the statement. Forgive us if we can’t always muster the enthusiasm people would like towards such statements, but we can’t forget some words have victims. Most vegans appreciate someone trying to make positive steps though and hope this leads to a more consequential change for animals and the environment.</p>`;

<p>This is a positive statement on many levels, reducing the animal products in our diets has positive ramifications for our health, environmental footprint and contribution to animal suffering. Unfortunately, people who say they don’t each much meat often aren't 100% in touch with reality, eating meat daily at lunch and dinner, sometimes even breakfast. If they have something without meat they don’t give the animals a break either because it usually involves eggs or dairy products. Perhaps people are eating smaller portions or more chicken and fish than they once did or even less meat than the people around them do, it’s hard to tell.</p>


<p>Not eating a lot of meat paradoxically doesn’t mean eating fewer animals, depending on what, or who, you are eating. Chickens, some of the most abused animals in the farming system, are small relative to pigs or cows. For each person in a wealthy country that eats their flesh and eggs, a sizeable flock of chickens is raised and murdered every year.  This is why tens of billions of them are currently imprisoned in factory farms around the globe. Fish, a regular substitute for people concerned about the ethics or health of their diet range in size but are often small. Human concern for them as individuals is exemplified by the fact that they aren't even counted in lives, just weighed in tonnes. People still have ancient, unscientific beliefs about fish not feeling pain, the same sort of unfounded justification that let Catholics eat fish on Fridays because the Church thought fish didn’t reproduce sexually. Many industrial fishing methods are so indiscriminate that much of the killing happens before it gets near your store and is simply bycatch, wild creatures suffering and dying simply to be tossed away as refuse. Suppose meat reduction means switching your diet from pigs and cattle to chickens and fish. In that case, it results in more animals in factory farms, crushed in nets, impaled with hooks, suffocated, and harried into slaughterhouses.</p>
<p>People consider dairy or eggs to be “deathless” industries, yet another sign of how divorced people have become from the reality of the animals they affect via their consumption. Male chickens are fed into grinders soon after being born, their sisters spend a life of suffering before being killed young before their reproduction drops off. Dairy cows are continually impregnated, and the unwanted male calves are taken and killed for veal. “Humane” farms let the male calves live longer before slaughtering them, often castrating them without anaesthetic to make them easier to handle. The dairy industry is a vast environmental and animal welfare disaster on par with the rest of the livestock industry. If you are serious about contributing to a better world with your diet, as far as animals are concerned you can't just swap meat for more eggs or cheese.</p>
<p>Our ideas of what a normal diet is are culturally shaped. People predominantly eat the way their parents did, for no better reason than that's what their parents did. The fact that someone eats less meat than their parent, relative or friend, or chooses white meats instead of red meat, is a relative, not an absolute improvement. Average meat consumption is too high according to peak dietary bodies who consistently encourage people to reduce their meat consumption and instead eat more fruits, vegetables, beans etc. Those same dietary bodies also point out that you can be just as healthy following a vegan diet as any other well-planned diet. There is no physiological need to eat meat, people do it out of habit but it is a choice we can change if we want to tread more lightly on the world. Studies show if people actually followed the healthier diets peak nutritional bodies recommend, it would correlate to a major reduction of animal and environmental harm.</p>
<p>After all this we need to fairly acknowledge some people are sincere in this and really don't eat much meat. If someone has many more days without meat than otherwise, or only eats meat at occasional social gatherings, then they might be able to claim to be not eating much meat. To everyone else saying this, we want to acknowledge the positive aspiration, but we can't help noticing you still eat a lot of animals.</p>
<p>For those who live and die in agribusiness systems, bred to be a product wrapped in plastic that someone uses and discards with no more thought to it than any other product; for our collective ecosystems under assault, the living systems of our world in decline, suffering from deforestation, water, air and chemical pollution; for the wild animals of the world under ever growing existential pressure from the land wasted on animal farming; for poor communities whose grain is sent to feed animals the wealthy consume; the optimal amount of animals we should eat is none. Getting there however will be a process of change in billions of individual lives, for many that will be gradual, their actions lagging through habit behind their ethical ideals. Our collective vegan future awaits, and the world that will entail is too important for us to tarry too long in transitional phases.
