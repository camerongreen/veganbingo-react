const short_answer = `<p>Current science tells us that the animals in our farming system have high levels of consciousness and central nervous systems almost identical to our own. If we are concerned about reducing our contribution to suffering in the world, then our ethical responsibilities toward them are clear, to stop having them confined and slaughtered. The science of plants is evolving but does not ascribe them similar levels of experience and consciousness. If in the future we find that plants have a high level of consciousness we will need to reconsider our actions toward them, but for now we should deal with the world we have.</p>`;

<p>Unfortunately people who say things like this are rarely next-level compassionate philosophers. They are usually less likely  to care about the plants, forests and ecosystems under attack from human encroachment than most people. What they are doing is trying to avoid looking too deeply at their own beliefs by diverting the question of their treatment of animals somewhere else. Humans have a long history of this sort of displacement, confronted with uncomfortable introspection about their own ethics, they eagerly point at the foolishness, duplicity and immorality of others, anything but deal with the uncomfortable emotions of looking with their own failings. They do not seriously care about plants, they are involved in an act of displacement.<p>


<p>What about plants? What are your shoes made of? What about people? What about, what about, all of this is displacement from seriously comprehending animal suffering. It is understandable, we fear judgement, we fear painful thoughts, uncertainty, change, but we must pay this price to live ethically. The immense scale of suffering humans cause in the farming industry cannot be brushed away with a question, or a trite statement. Doing so exhibits a profound emotional and philosophical immaturity, a lack of any engagement beyond the most surface level.</p>


<p>Conveniently many people’s ethical opinions align perfectly with and justify what they have always unthinkingly done, usually what their parental figures did and so on. Apparently the ethical life philosophers have been debating for centuries doesn’t need careful reflection, we just need to follow what these people have always done out of habit. Living ethically is unfortunately rarely so simple and part of the journey is constantly questioning our habits and cultural frames of reference. Moral character is not about justification, but is grounded in following the truth wherever it leads, an open and honest dialogue which can fearlessly question our own moral oversights and failings. Justifying the terrible lives and slaughter of sentient beings must be held to a high ethical and philosophical bar. Trying to displace it is a sign that someone doesn’t want to think about it deeply, and maybe even fears doing so.</p>


<p>Most of the animals we eat are herbivores, fed from the same farming system that we use to feed humans. Something like a third of the grain eaten in the world, and a higher percentage in developed countries, is used to feed livestock. Animals, especially larger ones, are inefficient converters of plant foods into edible human protein. Eating animals fed on plants means many more are used to feed us than if we just ate plants directly. The same logic follows for the animals killed as a byproduct of growing plants, it is unfortunate but still we kill less of them by not inefficiently cycling plant foods through other animals before we eat them. It is also revealing that meat eaters only began caring about the animals killed as a byproduct of their food system when they thought it could be a tool to intellectually beat vegans with. Vegans actually do care about these animals for their own sake, and it is only a farming system with a more vegan ethic that will start to more seriously look at how to minimise these unfortunate deaths.</p>


<p>Plants have their own evolutionary journey on this planet, that we should respect. It is an interesting question what our duty to them is. Beings deserve ethical consideration appropriate to their level of sentience. Plants don't have a central nervous system because its not evolutionary useful to feel intense pain if you can't do something in response to it like run away. Plant biology is many and varied, there is a lot to be said here but such nuances might be lost on anyone belligerent enough to ask this question. Still, we should try to assume the best of people, assume they ask questions or make statements sincerely, and treat it as an opportunity for growth. Consistent with evolutionary theory there aren't distinct, easily identifiable separate kingdoms of plants and animals, it is very much a continuum, a web of interrelated life stretching out over time and space. We do need to ask ourselves what our ethical duties are and on what basis we make our judgements. People who take animal suffering seriously sometimes think eating simple creatures like oysters and mussels, or eating honey are ethically justifiable. Vegans wouldn't do this, but we generally have greater respect for people who have thought things through and made ethically motivated changes than those who unconsciously accepted whatever line the people they grew up among did and justified it afterwards. For many societies in human history cannibalism, slavery, caste, oppression and many other things we now think are unethical were cultural norms. History teaches us that questioning the received wisdoms we were raised within is a requisite precursor to living ethically.</p>
<p>Darwin and the best biology since have understood that our common evolutionary heritage expresses itself in us, we share much of our sentience with other beings. Humans are not a different kind of being, we are a being with some differences, thus we do not exist in a separate moral universe. Many vegans follow a philosophy called sentientism, that all animal’s interests deserve consideration according to their level of sentience. This is opposed to speciesism, which treats all non-human life as having lesser worth, not because of their innate capabilities, but purely because they are not human. Speciesism also questions the treatment people give to their pets, feeding them on animals who have suffered in factory farms, animals who were just as unique and worthy of kindness as the cat and dog someone considers a member of their family.</p>
<p>Humans are a powerful, often destructive force on the processes of life in our world, and modern technology only increases this. As our collective footprint upon the world grows it is ever more urgent that we reconsider our philosophies and ways of living as they relate to the non-human world. We need to continually re-evaluate our moral framework, and carefully consider where we draw our moral lines and what our obligations are to the other beings who share our world.</p>


<p>Other life is here with us, not for us, it has its own evolutionary story that is not bound up in subservience to humanity. If we do find that plants have high levels of sentience, we will have to re-evaluate our positions and find a way to sustain ourselves ethically. Plants may have feelings, but we know the animals in our factory farms and slaughterhouses definitely do. We act with limited knowledge and information, we inevitably make mistakes, but when confronted with ethical questions history teaches us that it is best to err on the side of compassion.</p>
