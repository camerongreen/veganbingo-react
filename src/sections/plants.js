Eating animals who are fed with plant food is inefficient and ends up requiring a lot more plants to feed people. Whether you are concerned about the suffering of plants or animals, then the simplest thing to do is to eat more plants.</p>`;

<p>Unfortunately people who say things like this aren't next-level compassionate souls, they are usually even less likely than most people to care about plants, forests and ecosystems than they do non-human animals. What they are doing is trying to maintain a moral high ground which conveniently doesn’t require them to make any personal change. The ethical life philosophers have been debating for centuries didn’t need careful thinking and reflection, we just need to follow what these meat eaters have always done unthinkingly and out of habit, and justify it after the fact with ideas we hear along the way. Living ethically is unfortunately rarely so simple and we should question our habits and cultural frames of reference, following truth where it leads especially when it is inconvenient for us. We should hold justifying things like the terrible lives and slaughter of sentient beings to a high ethical and philosophical bar.</p>
<p>Most of the animals we eat are herbivores, fed from the same farming system that we use to feed humans. Something like a third of the grain eaten in the world, and a higher percentage in developed countries, is used to feed livestock. Animals, especially larger ones, are inefficient converters of plant foods into edible human protein. Eating animals fed on grain means many more plants are used to feed us than if we just ate plants directly. The same follows for the animals killed as a byproduct of growing those plants.</p>

<p>Plants don't have a central nervous system so evolutionarily it's not very useful to feel pain if you can't do something in response to it like run away. Plant biology is many and varied, there is a lot to be said here but such nuances might be lost on anyone belligerent enough to ask this question, still, we should try to assume the best. Consistent with evolutionary theory there aren't distinct, easily identifiable separate kingdoms of plants and animals, it is very much a continuum, a web of interrelated life. We do need to ask ourselves where we draw the line and on what basis we do so. People who take animal suffering as seriously as we do sometimes think eating simple creatures like oysters and mussels, or eating honey is OK ethically. Vegans wouldn't do this, but we generally have greater respect for people who have thought things through and made ethically motivated changes than those who unconsciously accepted whatever line the people they grew up among did. For many societies in human history cannibalism, slavery, oppression of religions, minorities, races, and many other things we now think are unethical were cultural norms, questioning the accepted norms we were raised with is a requisite part of living ethically.</p>
<p>Darwin and the best biologists since have understood that our common evolutionary heritage expresses itself in us, we share much of our sentience with other beings. In understanding how we should treat other beings ethically we need to discuss levels of self-awareness, the ability to suffer, the presence of a central nervous system, and the best science should be our guide. This philosophy is called sentientism, that all animal’s interests deserve consideration according to their level of sentience. This is opposed to speciesism, which treats all non-human life as having lesser worth, not because of their innate capabilities, but purely because they are not human.</p>
<p>Humans are a powerful, often destructive force on the processes of life in our world, and modern technology only increases this. As our collective footprint upon the world grows it is ever more urgent that we reconsider our philosophies and ways of living as they relate to the non-human world. We need to continually re-evaluate our moral framework, and carefully consider where we draw our moral lines and what our obligations are to the other beings who share our world.</p>

<p>Other life is here with us, not for us, it has its own evolutionary story that is not bound up in subservience to humanity. If we do find that plants have high levels of sentience, we will have to re-evaluate our positions and find another way to sustain ourselves ethically. We might make mistakes and we always act with limited knowledge and information but history teaches us that it is ethically safest to err on the side of compassion.</p>
