const short_answer = `<p>Like any large group, amongst millions of vegans we will find people with varying social and communication skills. Even if a messenger’s behaviour warrants shooting, the message they present might be worth thinking about. How well or poorly someone presents an argument or idea does not necessarily tell us whether it is important and true. Ignoring our deeply unfair relationship with non-human life because we met someone emotionally unintelligent is to punish the wrong victims. Take your own journey into the ethical arguments for veganism, because it matters too much to animal lives to wait until someone argues for veganism in a way you find appealing.</p>`;

<p>Vegans reflect the diversity of humanity, with all the normal flaws, biases and varying levels of emotional intelligence. There are some vegans who are so hostile and judgemental that by their negative example they actually discourage people from eating fewer animal products. If this is veganism, they imagine, I don’t want anything to do with it. Luckily for the animals, judgemental vegans are a minority. The majority of vegans are motivated by compassion for animals, and that includes animals who happen to be human. Still, veganism is an idea, not an individual or group of people. Engaging with veganism on any other level is to miss the ethical forest for the interpersonal trees.</p>


<p>Anyone who has had bad experiences with a preachy vegan should try this social experiment: try saying you are vegan. When you experience the sort of repetitive conversations and reactions that ensue you’ll realise why “Vegan Bingo” exists. Generally, most people are considerate, a few are even interested in knowing more about veganism. Some people however seem to have a major prejudice against veganism, and usually most other forms of socially progressive ideas as well. For all the preachy vegans in the world, there are many more angry people who think veganism, the idea that we should be more compassionate towards non-human animals, is a personal affront.</p>


<p>Many vegans have been in the situation of being out for a meal and enquiring about vegan options. A person, usually but not exclusively male, then starts bombarding them with poorly informed and often hostile questions. It’s actually worse than this in many social situations, the hostile person is representing the majority opinion around the table; a table of people who have apparently never cared about the animals they eat enough to look into the reality of factory farming. Arguing against a group involves dividing your attention between parallel conversations, and sometimes each poorly informed illogical argument thrown at you the mob celebrates like it has heard the purest pronouncements of Aristotle. It may be unfair, you may have intellectually and logically prevailed in every aspect of the conversation, but if you failed in the court of public opinion, you have not won. We may protest that ideas should be judged by their ethics and logic, but we know that is not reality, the medium is often more important than the message. That we are held to a higher standard is just part of life, keep your poise, and keep bringing the conversation back to the ethics of our treatment of animals.</p>


<p>But we still need to talk about preachy vegans. We’ve read the books, watched the videos, heard the cries from within factory farms, and smelt the stench that the farmed animals are kept in. We know and feel the emotional angst preachy vegans are expressing at all of the unnecessary human-caused suffering. But non-vegans don’t fully know or engage with these things, all they might see is an emotional person trying to win an argument with or emotionally blackmail them. Perhaps they see vegans as just another entity trying to inhabit a piece of their mind, like religions, politicians, marketers, salespeople and various charlatans. Vegans need to behave in a way that makes clear we are not just another group selfishly promoting our own interests. By carrying ourselves in such a way as to resonate with the compassion in others, not their defensiveness or sense of shame, we can most effectively advocate for the animals. This may require some internal work, but then learning to communicate in a kinder, more empathetic and ethically consistent way is work most people should to do at some point in their lives even for purposes other than vegan propaganda.</p>


<p>People often talk about “not preaching to the converted” but actually you need to continually educate, inspire and energise the converted. To the unconverted, you need more targeted, subtle and thoughtful ways of engaging than preaching. The converted may cheer angry preaching on from the sidelines, and you might gain a following, but it’s probably not effective in changing unengaged people. Hold your arguments to a high standard, one that even people who disagree with your perspective can’t help but acknowledge has merit.</p>


<p>Whilst discussing perspective, it’s interesting what is considered preaching and what isn’t. When local activists erected a billboard showing a racehorse injured during a race lying on its side (the horse was subsequently killed), they were forced to take the billboard down because people in the community were disturbed by the image. However, our suburbs are littered with billboards displaying burnt animal parts because people are conditioned not to see a part of an animal but simply “food”, so this is socially acceptable. It’s not just what you see that creates your world but also the story you tell yourself about it. Is that a piece of food or the burnt flesh of an intensively bred, malformed animal murdered prematurely after a terrible life? If you see only the former, you probably can’t comprehend anyone trying to talk about the latter, deeper truth. You might even subconsciously resist seeing the latter because you know it will be psychologically discomforting and ethically inconvenient. The truth of our relationship with animals may require you to change, to give up ideas you take for granted from within your current frame of reference, and to think about suffering. The task of advocating for animals is not just putting information out into the world, we have to help people open themselves to uncomfortable information in a way that doesn’t provoke emotional self-defence mechanisms and that is considerate of other traumas that people might already be dealing with. None of this is easy, but it is how we can best help the animals.</p>


<p>If I was an animal bred in a factory farm or on my way to slaughter, I’d desperately hope someone would help me. More importantly, I’d want them to be effective. Being right is not enough, to shout at the world in anger is probably counter-productive, the point is to change things, to make progress. People rarely change from one fact, phrase, sign, interaction or conversation, especially if it is put to them in a hostile manner. As much as 80 billion animals in factory farms burns us, we have to accept that the world is unlikely to radically change tomorrow. We need to be playing a long-term, structural, game involving economics, philosophy, psychology and politics. Emotions are vital to this, but their power needs to be carefully harnessed so that we are effective.</p>


<p>If you want to be an effective vegan advocate, even a preachy vegan, you need to do the work. Read about psychology and effective behaviour change, the history of our movement and its thinkers, the arguments and justifications of the other side, the lives of farmed animals, the livestock industry’s effects on the environment, human rights and our political systems. You don’t have to know everything, indeed you should be quick to acknowledge that you don’t, but you don’t want to come off as ill-informed and overly idealistic. Like any conversation, it is important to try to listen, seriously consider other points of view, make them feel heard and look for common ground on which to build. Keep in mind before we judge others that most of us haven’t always been vegan and even once we are, always have other areas to ethically improve upon.</p>


<p>There is also the question of effectively using our emotional resources and time. The random people you meet on a street, who walk past a protest, even your friends and family, may not be the subset of the community most open to change. If you want to make change at a wider level, being part of an activist group is powerful. Having a group to think about plans and campaigns with, that has a variety of skills and perspectives and that can survive when “life happens” and people drop in and out over time is a way of multiplying our individual efforts. Activism doesn’t have to be confrontational, that may not even be a particularly effective form of activism, compared to focusing on people already sympathetic to living according to compassionate ideals. There are so many open doors to push on, people who are ready to change, who just need advice and help.</p>


<p>Like it or not, whatever identity we have, especially if we are a minority, we will be a representative of that identity in the world. To be an effective advocate for animals we must understand that the medium and the message are inextricably intertwined. Wearing a judgemental shirt, or shouting angrily at the world may feel powerful, it may even win you approval within certain circles, but is it effective? What is the image we leave in people’s minds, an angry activist’s face and words or the plight of animals? Veganism is about compassion to all animals, humans included, so try not to confuse that simple truth in other people’s minds.</p>


<p>Finally, many people consider whether they consume animals to be solely an individual, personal choice, ignoring the lives of animals it affects. If we worry that the transition to a vegan lifestyle might be inconvenient for us, think for a moment about what our personal choices mean to the life and death of an animal in a factory farm. When our choices have victims, they are no longer personal.</p>`;
