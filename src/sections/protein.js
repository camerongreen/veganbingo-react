const short_answer = `<p>When you mention you are vegan, some people suddenly turn into an amateur nutritionist. Almost all nutrients come from plants, and humans can just get them directly without needing an animal to suffer in between. Healthy vegans don’t just remove animal products from their diet, they replace them with extra nuts, beans, seeds, lentils, peas, seitan, tempeh, tofu and other plant-derived foods high in protein.</p>`;

<p>At a party many years ago an 8-year-old was bringing around snacks. I declined what he offered to me, but told him I’d be interested if they had vegan options. He then asked me where I get my protein from. When something is so deep in the culture that it is in the head of children, it makes you wonder how it got there.</p> 
<p>Why do people ask about protein in particular? B12 for instance is actually hard to get from plants alone, so sensible vegans take a daily supplement, but we are rarely asked about B12. A hint about where the protein question derives is the gender of the people who usually ask it. Protein is associated with strength, muscular development and masculinity.</p>
<p>Meat being gendered has a long history in the human psyche, most hunter-gatherer societies had gendered divisions of labour, with men often taking on more hunting duties. Like many evolutionary human tendencies, this is seen as something to exploit by the marketing industry. There has been a sustained effort to further the association between men and meat eating in order to sell more animal products. Typical of this were the high rotation “Feed the man meat” advertisements on Australian television, which revealingly showed a father reading the newspaper at the table with the children whilst the mother brought the heated-up leg of a lamb in from the kitchen. Meat is a high-profit product, in many places a luxury, and animal farming often benefits from government subsidies and cheap land. They are an industry with the resources to push their narrative, especially one we might be predetermined by our evolution to accept. Studies show even female vegetarians see men who don’t eat meat as less masculine (though they omit to say whether the female vegetarians thought that was a good or bad thing). There is a sexual politics to meat, masculinity and especially toxic masculinity is aligned with the killing of animals for food.</p>

<p>Meat and dairy industry propaganda reach far more people than any unbiased nutritional advice. They have long used their financial and political sway to ensure a dominant voice on government nutritional panels, and have been repeatedly successful in watering down attempts to make national eating guidelines more plant-based. They need to maintain this propaganda war because nutritional science is often not on their side. There is no study that shows protein deficiency in people following a plant-based diet, or indeed in any population, that eats enough calories. National eating guidelines cannot completely ignore science and have thus been incrementally becoming more plant-friendly, especially in recognising plant-derived sources of protein.</p>
<p>Still what Dietitians think, I've had elite medical professionals from other fields ask me where I get my protein from. Unfortunately, most medical professionals don't get adequate nutritional training and are as susceptible to the unquestioned ideas laying around in the culture as everyone else. Looking at what the peak nutritional bodies in the world say, we find similar things to the position of the American Dietetic Association:</p>
<blockquote>appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.
</blockquote>
<p>People who ask about protein rarely know how much protein we need, how much is in different plant foods, or how many high-profile athletes follow a vegan diet. There’s no shame in this, we aren’t born knowing such things, but it would seem reasonable to investigate them before you go around doling out nutritional advice to other people.</p>
<p>Finally there is a serious point here, we should take note of the words “appropriately planned” from the American Dietetic Society quote above. Vegan diets aren’t a magic bullet, like all diets they can be unhealthy if done the wrong way. A vegan diet is different to the one many of us grew up eating, so there might be some adjustment needed, particularly if they grew up in a family following a meat-centric diet. Healthy vegans don’t just remove things from their diets, there is a whole world of ingredients, particularly the incredible variety of beans and legumes, which they add. Vegans don’t need to worry as much about fibre, antioxidants, healthy fats, vitamin C and the other goodies fruits, vegetables and plant protein sources are loaded with but they do need to ensure they have adequate sources of things like B12, calcium, vitamin D and omega 3s.</p>
<p>In the end though we should be getting our nutritional advice from qualified dietitians, not friends, family, random people, social media or even Vegan Bingo. A great investment in life is to book a couple of sessions with a nutritionist who understands plant-based diets, to make sure the core of your diet is helping maintain your long-term physical and mental health. Healthy food is a gift we can give ourselves that will reverberate out into the world and our life, as Hippocrates said, "Let thy food be thy medicine".</p>
