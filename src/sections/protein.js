const short_answer = `<p>When you mention you are vegan, some people suddenly turn into an amateur nutritionist. Most nutrients come from plants and humans can just get them directly without needing an animal to suffer in between. Healthy vegans don’t just remove animal products from their diet, they balance their diet with nuts, beans, seeds, lentils, peas, seitan, tempeh, tofu and other plant-derived foods high in protein.</p>`;

<p>At a party many years ago an 8-year-old was bringing around snacks. I declined what he offered but mentioned I’d be interested in any vegan options. He then promptly asked me where I get my protein from. When something is so deep in the culture that it is in the head of children, it makes you wonder how it got there.</p> 
<p>Why do people ask about protein in particular? B12 for instance is harder to get from plants alone, so sensible vegans take a daily supplement, but we are rarely asked about B12. A hint about where the protein question derives is the gender of the people who usually ask about it. Protein is associated with strength, muscular development and masculinity.</p>
<p>The gendered aspects of killing animals has a long history in the human psyche. Most hunter-gatherer societies had gendered divisions of labour, with men taking on more of the hunting tasks, especially of larger animals. Like many of our evolutionary tendencies, this is part of our thinking ripe for exploitation by the marketing industry. There has been a sustained effort to harden the association between masculinity and meat-eating in order to sell unnecessary products. Typical of this were the high rotation “Feed the man meat” advertisements on Australian television, which revealingly showed a father reading the newspaper at the table with the children whilst the mother brought a burnt, severed leg in from the kitchen. Meat is a high-profit product, in many places a status symbol, and animal farming often benefits from government subsidies and cheap land. They are an industry with the resources to push a false narrative, that meat is natural, normal, nice and necessary. Studies show even female vegetarians see men who don’t eat meat as less masculine (though the study omits whether the female vegetarians thought that was a good or bad thing). There is inarguably a sexual politics to meat. Masculinity is aligned with the killing of animals for food, the more toxic the masculinity the more closely aligned.</p>

<p>Meat and dairy industry propaganda reaches far more people than unbiased nutritional advice. The industry has long used its financial and political sway to ensure a dominant voice on government nutritional panels and has been repeatedly successful in watering down attempts to make national eating guidelines healthier. They need to maintain this propaganda war because nutritional science is generally not on their side. There is no study that shows protein deficiency in people who eat enough calories, whether they are following a plant-based diet or otherwise. National eating guidelines have slowly recognised plant-based sources of protein, such as lentils which humans have been eating for at least 80,000 years because the guidelines are increasingly being asked to respond to science and human health rather than the economic interests of those with power. That this change has correlated with less patriarchal governments generally is unlikely to be pure coincidence.</p>
<p>The modern understanding of dietitians has been slow to filter outwards even in the medical community. I've had an elite cardiologist ask me where I get my protein from. Unfortunately, most medical professionals don't get anything beyond elementary nutritional training and are as susceptible to the unquestioned ideas laying around in the culture as everyone else. Looking at the public stances of peak nutritional bodies around the world, we find similar things to the position of the American Dietetic Association:</p>
<blockquote>appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.
</blockquote>
<p>People who ask about protein rarely know how much protein we need, how much is actually in different plant foods, or that many athletes, including weight lifters and bodybuilders, follow a vegan diet. There’s no shame in this, we aren’t born knowing such things, but it would seem reasonable to investigate them before you go around doling out nutritional advice to other people.</p>
<p>Finally there is a serious point here, we should take note of the words “appropriately planned” from the American Dietetic Society quote above. Vegan diets aren’t a magic bullet, like all diets they can be unhealthy if they contain too much sugar and fat, and not enough fruits, vegetables and whole grains. A vegan diet is different to the one many of us grew up eating, so there might be some adjustment needed, particularly if they grew up in a family following a meat-centric diet and don’t know how to cook any other way. Healthy vegans don’t just remove things from their diets, there is a whole world of ingredients, particularly the incredible variety of beans and legumes, which they add. Vegans don’t need to worry as much about fibre, antioxidants, healthy fats, vitamin C and the other goodies fruits, vegetables and plant protein sources are loaded with but they do need to ensure they have adequate sources of things like B12, calcium, vitamin D and omega 3s.</p>
<p>In the end we should be getting our nutritional advice from qualified dietitians, not friends, family, random people, social media or what you happen to be reading now. A great investment in life is to book a couple of sessions with a nutritionist who understands plant-based diets, to make sure the core of your diet is helping maintain your long-term physical and mental health. Healthy food is a gift we can give ourselves, that will help our physical and mental health, and will reverberate positively out into the world. As Hippocrates said, "Let thy food be thy medicine".</p>
