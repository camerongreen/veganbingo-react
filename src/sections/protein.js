const short_answer = `<p>When you mention you are vegan, many people abruptly become a nutritionist. Most nutrients, protein included, come from plants and we can get them directly without any animal suffering in between. Healthy vegans don’t just remove animal products, they swap them with other things. In the case of protein with nuts, beans, seeds, lentils, peas, seitan, tempeh, quinoa, tofu and a host of other healthy plant-derived foods.</p>`;

<p>At a party many years ago, a boy who looked about 10 was bringing around snacks. I declined the offerings but mentioned I’d be interested in any vegan options. He then promptly asked me where I get my protein from. When something is so deep in the culture that it is in the head of children, it makes you wonder how it got there.</p> 


<p>There has never been a study which showed people who had an adequate diet of any sort suffered from protein deficiency. So why are non-vegans obsessed with protein above the myriad other things which people need to be healthy? B12 for instance is harder to get from plants alone, so people who abstain from animal products should take a regular supplement, but we are rarely asked about B12. A hint about where the protein question derives is the gender of the people who usually ask about it. Protein is associated with strength, muscles and masculinity.</p>


<p>The gendered aspects of killing animals have a long history in the human psyche. Most forager societies had gendered tendencies towards labour, with men taking on more of the hunting tasks, especially of larger animals. Given that men focused on this higher status task it will come as little surprise that studies show most diets in the palaeolithic era were heavily plant-based. Like many of our less helpful evolutionary tendencies, this association between masculinity and violent killing is ripe for exploitation by the marketing industry. There has been a sustained and well funded marketing effort to tighten the association between masculinity and meat-eating. Typical of this were the high rotation “Feed the man meat” advertisements on 1980s Australian television. The ads placed a father relaxing at the table with a newspaper with the children whilst the mother brought in a burned, severed leg on a plate. Meat is a high-profit product, in many places a status symbol, and animal farming often benefits from government subsidies and cheap land. They are an industry with the resources to push any narrative, that meat is natural, normal, nice and necessary. Studies show even female vegetarians see men who abstain from meat as more feminine (though they omit whether the female vegetarians thought that was a good thing). There is inarguably a sexual politics of meat. Masculinity is aligned with the killing of animals for food, the more toxic the masculinity the more closely aligned. Women tend to eat less meat than men, the majority of vegans are women, and women generally hold more pro-social views. Instead of clinging to their toxic masculinity, perhaps if many men could rid themselves of toxic masculinity, we could all progress a little faster to a better world together. It was the gatherers, not the hunters who had it right all along.</p>


<p>When decent people participate in cruelty, they must first be convinced that it is absolutely necessary. Meat and dairy industry propaganda reaches far more people than unbiased nutritional advice. The industry has long used its financial and political sway to ensure a dominant voice on government nutritional panels and has been repeatedly successful in watering down attempts to make national eating guidelines healthier. They maintain this propaganda war because nutritional science often contradicts perceived national and regional financial self-interest. The United Nations lists smallgoods like bacon as known, and red meat generally as likely, cancer risks. Even at their best other forms of animal products are unnecessary to a complete diet.</p>


<p>National eating guidelines have slowly recognised plant-based sources of protein, such as lentils (one of the first crops humans domesticated) because the guidelines are increasingly being asked to respond to science and human health rather than the economic interests and power. That this change has correlated with less patriarchal governments and more women in positions of power generally is unlikely to be pure coincidence.</p>


<p>The modern understanding of dietitians has been slow to filter outwards even in the medical community. I've had an elite cardiologist ask me where I get my protein from, and I know people who have heard such things from their doctors. Unfortunately, most medical professionals don't get anything beyond elementary nutritional training and are as susceptible to the unquestioned ideas laying around in the culture as everyone else. One study found doctors in the US and UK got about 11 hours of nutritional training during their many years long degrees. If we look at dietitians, the people who specialise in the health aspects of food, we usually see a very different story. The public stances of peak nutritional bodies around the world generally state similar things to the following position of the American Dietetic Association:</p>


<blockquote>appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.
</blockquote>


<p>Evidence that the question about protein is an uninformed, knee-jerk reaction is that people who ask about protein rarely know how much we need or how much is actually in different foods. There’s no shame in not knowing everything about nutrition, we aren’t born knowing such things, but it would seem reasonable to investigate a little before you criticise people’s diets or dole out nutritional advice. Many high-profile athletes, including weightlifters and bodybuilders, follow a vegan diet, clearly they are getting what their bodies need for peak performance. We can all consult the same nutritional authorities as those vegan athletes do, and eat healthier diets that are also kinder animals.</p>


<p>For vegans there is a serious point here, we should take note of the words “appropriately planned” from the American Dietetic Society quote above. Vegan diets aren’t a magic bullet, like all diets they can be unhealthy if they contain too much sugar and fat, and not enough fruits, vegetables, pulses and whole grains. A vegan diet is different to the one many of us grew up eating, so there might be some adjustment needed, particularly if people grew up in a family following a meat-centric diet and havent learned to cook any other way. Healthy vegans don’t just remove things from their diets, there is a whole world of ingredients, particularly the incredible variety of beans and legumes, which they add to them. Vegans who eat a whole foods, plant based diet don’t need to worry much about fibre, antioxidants, healthy fats, vitamin C and the other goodies fruits, vegetables and plant protein sources are loaded with but they do might to ensure they have adequate sources of things like calcium, vitamin D and omega 3s, and of course they should supplement B12.</p>


<p>In the end we should be getting our nutritional advice from qualified dietitians, not friends, family, random people, social media or even the fine text you happen to be reading now. A great investment in life is every now and then book a couple of sessions with a university-qualified nutritionist who understands plant-based diets, to make sure the core of your diet is working towards your long-term physical and mental health. Healthy food is a gift we can give ourselves and others, that will help maintain physical and mental health, and that will reverberate positively out into the world. As Hippocrates said, "Let thy food be thy medicine".</p>
