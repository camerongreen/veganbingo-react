const short_answer = `<p>Justifying killing sentient creatures for pleasure should never be done lightly, and it should require an understanding of comparative biology slightly more advanced than that of a mediaeval peasant. Look at any carnivorous mammal’s teeth, then look at a herbivorous mammal, then look at ours, end of the story. Evolutionarily humans were at best opportunistic omnivores, the fact that we have “canine” teeth is of little more relevance than the fact we have things called an Achilles heel or Adam’s apple.</p>`;

<p>Reality is often a problem for people who profess things that they don’t really know about. The Greek philosopher Aristotle was one of the greatest minds in history, so much so he was just called “the philosopher” for centuries, suffered from this as much as anyone. He wrote that women had fewer teeth than men did. Of course, if he had taken the time to look in the mouth of more than one or two women, he would have realised this was ridiculous.

The same thing can be said about the idea that canine teeth are evidence we are meat eaters, just look at the teeth of a carnivore or a herbivore, and think again. Human teeth are so overwhelmingly, obviously similar to herbivores, that it is hard to understand anyone bringing this up as an argument for human meat eating. Still, there is that word canine, which people clearly don’t think very far beyond.</p>
<p>”Canine” is the name given to a couple of our teeth which are also called eye teeth, or even cuspids by people who really know what they are doing. Lots of animals who eat various diets have canine teeth, antelopes, deer, camels, horses, boars, seals and walruses. Human canine teeth look rather lame compared to some of our completely herbivorous relatives. Highland gorillas for instance have fierce canine teeth, but other than the occasional insect, they live on plants. Canine teeth are used for dominance displays, fighting, gripping and tearing all sorts of food, often plants. Indeed even dogs are pretty omnivorous partly because they have lived with us for so long, but unlike our teeth, theirs do actually betray carnivorous origins.</p>
<p>Human teeth being mostly herbivorous teeth tell us something about the role of meat in our evolutionary diet. Like our closest ape relatives during our evolution, we lived primarily on plants. Some of our closest relatives such as chimpanzees eat meat, but it is an incidental part of their diet. It’s likely we were the same, and this is consistent with the cliche of nutritionists telling us to eat more fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p>As for the idea that meat eating was responsible for developing larger brains, it is an idea some people want to believe but there isn’t solid evidence for it. Obviously, any additional source of nutrients would be helpful, especially in hard times, but beyond theories, there is nothing clear in the research on this. Far more compelling as an explanation is our harnessing of fire, that our brain development was aided by the additional food sources and nutrients that cooking unlocked, especially plant starches. Looking back on prehistoric times isn’t easy in any case, maybe we’ll have more knowledge in the future but for now, rash claims are unwarranted, especially ones being used to justify modern humanity’s terrible treatment of animals.</p>
<p> Forward-facing eyes is a strange one but it comes up. We have two separate eyes to enable depth perception just like most animals. The theory is that for prey species eyes are wider apart, to allow better peripheral vision to see attackers. So far so good, where it gets muddled is in people thinking that if you don't have eyes on the sides of your head, that makes you a carnivore. Again we return to Aristotle’s problem, just look at the actual world. Starting with our ape cousins we could list many species which have forward-facing eyes and are primarily or solely herbivores, or ones that have eyes on the sides of their heads and are carnivores. Eye placement is clearly no clear evolutionary sign of a single thing.</p>
<p>Overall the science in respect of human anatomy and our evolutionary diet is pretty clear, though we have been omnivores for many hundreds of thousands of years our anatomy is predominantly that of a herbivore. We have opportunistically supplemented our diet with meat with some theories based on our digestion saying we might have been scavengers, but it wasn’t the main part of our diet. There is clearly a reason dietitians keep telling us to eat more fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p>Most of us now live in an environment where many types of food are superabundant. Nutritional science tells us we can live healthily on a variety of different diets, vegan included and that most people would benefit from moving more towards a whole food, plant-based diet. Using our biology as a justification for our treatment of animals is not consistent with modern science. Once you strip away the urban myths, you are left with a simple fact. It is up to our conscience to decide what, or who, we eat.</p>
