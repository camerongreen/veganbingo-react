const short_answer = `Justifying killing should never be done lightly, and it should require an understanding of comparative biology slightly more advanced than that of a mediaeval peasant. Start by looking at a carnivorous mammal’s teeth, then look at a herbivorous mammal, then look at ours. Evolutionarily humans were at best opportunistic omnivores, the fact that we call something “canine” teeth is of little more relevance than the fact we have things called an Achilles heel or Adam’s apple. `;

<p>Reality is often a problem for people who like to profess things that they don’t really know about. The Greek philosopher Aristotle was one of the greatest minds in history, so much so he was simply called “the philosopher” for centuries. He wrote that women had fewer teeth than men did. Of course, if he had taken the time to look in the mouth of more than one or two women, he would have realised his error.</p>


<p>Much the same thing can be said about the idea that canine teeth are evidence we are meat eaters, spend a little time looking at the teeth of a carnivore or a herbivore before you express opinions about it. Human teeth are so overwhelmingly, obviously similar to herbivores, that it is hard to understand anyone bringing this up as an argument for human meat eating, if anything it should lead to precisely te opposite conclusion. Still, there is that word canine, which people don’t think very far beyond.</p>
<p>”Canine” is the name given to a couple of our teeth which are also called eye teeth, or even cuspids by people who drill them and pull them out. Lots of animals who eat various diets have canine teeth, antelopes, deer, camels, horses, boars, seals and walruses. Human canine teeth look rather inoffensive compared to some of our completely herbivorous relatives. Highland gorillas for instance have fierce canine teeth, but other than the occasional insect, they live on plants. Canine teeth are used for dominance displays, fighting, gripping and tearing plant foods. Indeed even dogs after who they are named, are omnivorous partly because they have lived with us for so long. Unlike our teeth though, dog teeth clearly betray carnivorous origins.</p>
<p>Human teeth being mostly like herbivores tells us something about the role of meat in our evolutionary diet. Like our closest evolutionary relatives we lived primarily on plants. Some of our closest relatives such as chimpanzees eat meat, but it is an incidental part of their diet. It’s likely we were the same.</p>
<p>As for the idea that meat eating was responsible for developing larger brains, it is an idea some people want to be true because it would suppress any ethical qualms they have about our treatment of animals, but there isn’t solid evidence for it. Obviously, any additional source of nutrients would be helpful, especially in hard times, but beyond theories, there is nothing clear in the research on this. Far more compelling as an explanation is our harnessing of fire, that our brain development was aided by the additional food sources and nutrients that cooking unlocked, especially plant starches. Looking back on prehistoric times is rarely easy, maybe we’ll have more knowledge in the future but for now, rash claims are unwarranted. I also think claims being used to justify modern humanity’s terrible treatment of animals should be held to a higher bar.</p>
<p>Forward-facing eyes is a strange one but it comes up. We have two separate eyes that enable depth perception just like most animals. The theory is that for prey species eyes are wider apart, to allow better peripheral vision to see attackers. So far so good, where it gets muddled is in thinking that if you don't have eyes on the sides of your head, that makes you a carnivore. Again we return to Aristotle’s problem, just look at the actual world. Starting with our ape cousins we could list many species which have forward-facing eyes and are primarily or solely herbivores, or ones that have eyes on the sides of their heads that are carnivores. Eye placement is clearly no clear evolutionary sign of a single thing.</p>
<p>Overall the science in respect of human anatomy and our evolutionary diet is pretty clear, though we have been omnivores for many hundreds of thousands of years our anatomy is predominantly that of a herbivore. We have opportunistically supplemented our diet with meat with some theories based on our digestion saying we might have primarily been scavengers, but it wasn’t the main part of our diet. There is clearly an evolutionary reason dietitians tell us to eat mostly fruits, vegetables and whole grains to be healthy.</p>
<p>Most of us now live in environments where a vast number of foods are superabundant. Nutritional science tells us we can live healthily on many different diets, vegan included, and that most people would benefit from moving more towards a whole food, plant-based diet. Using biology to justify our treatment of animals is not consistent with modern science. Once you strip away what people would like to believe, you are left with a simple truth of profound ethical importance to the world. We now have the freedom to use our conscience in deciding what, or who, we eat.</p>
