<p>Canine are a description of a couple of our teeth, also called cuspids, eye teeth and a few other things. Lots of animals have them, antelopes, deer, camel, horses, boar, seals, walrus. Human canine teeth look rather lame compared to some of our completely herbivorous relatives. Gorillas have pretty fierce ones, and other than eating insects, live on plants. Canine teeth are used for gripping and tearing food, dominance displays and weapons, but they don't mean an animal eats meat.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that the name canine has caused so much confusion. Having canine teeth provides no more justification for eating meat than our \\"achilles\\" tendon means we are all invulnerable warriors.</p>
<p>Human teeth are omnivorous teeth. Actually look in a carnivore's mouth sometime, then look in a herbivores mouth. You'll see pretty clearly ours resemble the latter, and of course they do, like all the other apes during our evolution we lived primarily on plants. Some of our closest relatives such as chimpanzees eat meat, but it is an incidental part of their diet.</p>
<p>As for meat eating helping our evolution, well any additional source of nutrients is helpful, but there isn't a great amount of evidence for this proposition. Far more compelling evidence is that it was cooking and the extra foods we could eat, especially the starches that probably fuelled our brain development. It is a difficult area though, looking back to such ancient times, so thus rash claims are unwarranted.</p>
<p>Forward facing eyes is a strange one but it comes up. We have two separate eyes to enable depth perception just like most animals. The theory is that for prey species they are wider apart, giving them better peripheral vision to see attackers. So far so good, where it gets muddled is in people thinking that if you don't have eyes on the sides of your head, that makes you a carnivore. I was going to list animals which have forward facing eyes and are herbivores or omnivores, or ones which have eyes on the sides of their heads and are carnivores, but I figure you can do that yourself. Once you've done that for about five seconds you'll understand that eye placement is no clear evolutionary sign of any single thing.</p>
<p>Overall the science in respect of human anatomy and diet is pretty clear, though we have been omnivores for many hundreds of thousands of years our anatomy is still predominantly that of a herbivore. We have opportunistically supplemented our diet with meat whilst primarily surviving on a plant based diet. It is no surprise that dietitians are always telling us to eat more fruits and vegetables, because that is what we are evolving to primarily eat.</p>
<p>Ultimately, if we can live healthily on a variety of different diets, then it is up to our conscience not our biology to choose which we should adopt.</p>
