const short_answer = `This is a false dichotomy, we are complex beings who can care about more than one thing. Beyond that, compassion which widens it’s circle of empathy also deepens it. Surveys consistently find people who are compassionate to animals are also more likely than others to care about human rights and the environment. It is unnecessary to ration our compassion, and we strengthen our compassion by not doing so.`;

<p>The premise of this statement is that there is a fixed hierarchy of suffering, humans and everything else less worthy beneath. Whilst a human suffers, we shouldn't concern ourselves with the suffering of billions of non-humans. No evidence is given as to why such a choice should be made, nor is likely to be given. The best science shows that the ability to suffer is shared by all sentient beings and the best social science shows that people who care about non-human animals have a circle of compassion which also embraces humans more fully.</p>
<p>As Martin Luther King said, "Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere”. We can care about many things, the environment, our friends and families, people in poverty and the suffering of animals without diminishing any of them. Indeed, there is much to be said for fostering moral consistency within ourselves, of as Aristotle said, strengthening our moral muscle through use.</p>
<p>A plant-based diet obviously reduces the number of animals suffering through slaughter and lives in factory farms, but it reverberates out in many other ways. Livestock’s inconvenient long shadow is involvement in most environmental problems from a local to global scale, covering as it does over half of the arable surface of the earth. The way we farm animals is one of the primary drivers of the destructive Anthropocene, contributingto air pollution, water contamination, land degradation, species extinction, deforestation, invasive species and of course climate change. The scale of this industry is almost unimaginable. Only 3% of the current mass of land animals are wild creatures, with the other 97% being humans and their livestock. Two-thirds of the mass of all birds in the world are now farmed chickens. The many billions of livestock animals consume many times enough grain to provide for the remaining food-poor regions of the world. Almost all the communicable diseases that have plagued humanity throughout history have been a result of our contact with animals, from colds and flu to the black death, ebola and AIDs. Add to this that the majority of antibiotics in the world are fed to healthy livestock, and the industry’s potential contribution to anti-biotic resistance threatens to undermine one of the great human health break throughs of our time.</p>
<p>There is so much to be said about the positive effects on humanity of progressing beyond eating animals. It is not about choosing one species over the other, it is about a reverence for our world and collective progress. Switching to a more compassionate diet that can be at least as healthy as our current diet will also ensure the health of life on earth.</p>
<p>Many great thinkers have keenly perceived the moral connection between our treatment of humans and non-humans:</p>
<blockquote>Whilst there are slaughterhouses, there will still be battlefields<figcaption>- Tolstoy</figcaption></blockquote>
<blockquote>Until we stop harming all other living beings, we are still savages<figcaption>- Thomas Edison</figcaption></blockquote>
<blockquote>We can judge the heart of a man by his treatment of animals<figcaption>- Immanuel Kant</figcaption></blockquote>
<blockquote>If you have men who will exclude any of god's creatures from the shelter of compassion and pity, you will have men who will deal likewise with their fellow men<figcaption>- St Francis of Assisi</figcaption></blockquote>
<blockquote>By killing, man suppresses in himself, unnecessarily, the highest spiritual capacity, that of sympathy and pity towards living creatures like himself<figcaption>- Tolstoy</figcaption></blockquote>
<blockquote>While we ourselves are the living graves of murdered beasts, how can we expect any ideal conditions on this earth?<figcaption>- George Bernard Shaw</figcaption></blockquote>
<blockquote>For as long as men massacre animals, they will kill each other<figcaption>- Pythagoras</figcaption></blockquote>
<blockquote>The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated<figcaption>- Mahatma Gandhi</figcaption></blockquote>
<blockquote>Until he extends the circle of his compassion to all living things, man will not himself find peace<figcaption>- Albert Schweitzer</figcaption></blockquote>
<p>The self-serving idea that humans are in a different moral sphere to other animals is a self-serving, largely pre-Darwinian conception of ourselves which has both destructive and cruel consequences. Modern science shows that we are relatives in the same family tree, the vast majority of our biology predates modern human brain development. Our shared evolutionary nature means that much of our human emotional, intellectual and physical experience of existence is shared to some degree by other sentient life, exponentially more so with those that have high levels of sentience. However imperfectly, empathy gives us a window into the emotional world non-human animals experience, most importantly what it is like to suffer.</p>
<p>To look into the eyes of a dog, a cow, or a child is to see something of ourselves looking back at us, wondering about us. Many animals share with us deep parts of the magical spark of consciousness, to justify diminishing or extinguishing that spark because they do not share our identity is an injustice. We are all earthlings, sharing this experience of an existence we did not choose, together. The great power we hold collectively over the lives of the other species of this world means the moral choices we make should be deeply thought through. Ignoring the lives other beings lead before they arrive in our supermarkets bled out, dismembered and packaged has led to widespread suffering and injustice.</p>
<p>Trying to live an ethical life is difficult, it asks much of us, requiring changing habits and learning new ways, of thinking about things that perhaps it would be more convenient for us not to think about. Sometimes the separation from our old selves, however positive, can cause friction in our lives and among the people who would prefer we validate their mindset by staying in it with them. There is a higher realm of human thought though, one that calls to us beyond the small worlds of human interaction and selfish desire. We have seen tangible progress in recent centuries, our societies discarded some of the worst barbarities towards each other and even some towards animals. One of the most meaningful things we can do in life, is join our voice, our power to this positive direction for our world. Our intellectual and moral progression is bound up in the liberation of the oppressed, especially those who we oppress.  Forward, together.</p>
