const short_answer = `This is a false dichotomy, we can care about both. Surveys consistently find vegans are more likely than other members of the community to care about human rights and the environment. Now, only do we not have to choose one over the other, but we are better for not making the choice. The intellectual and moral progression of the oppressor is bound to the liberation of those they oppress.`;

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/html">The premise of this statement is that there is some sort of fixed hierarchy of suffering, humans and everything else beneath. Whilst any humans suffer apparently we shouldn't concern ourselves with the suffering of billions of non-humans. No evidence is given as to why such a choice should be made, nor is likely to be given because the best science shows that the ability to suffer is shared by all sentient beings and that people who care about non-human animals have a circle of compassion which embraces humans more fully.</p>
<p>We can care about many things, the environment, our friends and families, people in poverty and the suffering of animals without diminishing any of them. Indeed, there is much to be said for fostering moral consistency within ourselves. As Martin Luther King said, "Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere”.</p>
<p>Teaching universal compassion helps all who can suffer because we feel on an instinctive level that injustice towards humans and non-human animals are directly related.</p>
<p>A plant-based diet obviously reduces the number of animals suffering through slaughter and lives in factory farms, but it reverberates out in many other ways.  Livestock’s inconvenient long shadow is its involvement in almost every environmental problem from local to a global scale, covering as it does over half of the arable surface of the earth. Air pollution, water quality, land degradation, species extinction, deforestation, invasive species, climate change, and the way we farm animals is one of the primary drivers of the destructive Anthropocene. Only 3% of land animal mass is now wild creatures, with the other 97% being humans and their livestock. Two-thirds of the mass of birds in the world are now farmed chickens. The many billions of livestock animals consume many times enough grain to feed the remaining food-poor regions of the world. A plant-based world would feed more people with less land. Almost all the communicable diseases that have plagued humanity throughout history have been a result of our contact with animals, from colds and flu to the black death, ebola and AIDs.</p>
<p>There is so much to be said about the positive effects on humanity of progressing beyond eating animals. It is not about choosing one species over the other, it is about a reverence for our world and collective progress. Switching to a more compassionate diet that can be at least as healthy as our current diet will also ensure the health of life on earth. 
It has been said ethics is like a muscle that goes stronger with use, a habit we can easily fall into or out of. We should be encouraging compassion in all spheres of life, not playing one being off against each other. Many of the great thinkers of the past have seen the moral connection between our treatment of humans and non-humans:</p>
<blockquote>Whilst there are slaughterhouses, there will still be battlefields<figcaption>- Tolstoy</figcaption></blockquote>
<blockquote>Until we stop harming all other living beings, we are still savages<figcaption>— Thomas Edison</figcaption></blockquote>
<blockquote>We can judge the heart of a man by his treatment of animals<figcaption>— Immanuel Kant</figcaption></blockquote>
<blockquote>If you have men who will exclude any of god's creatures from the shelter of compassion and pity, you will have men who will deal likewisewith their fellow men<figcaption>— St Francis of Assisi</figcaption></blockquote>
<blockquote>By killing, man suppresses in himself, unnecessarily, the highest spiritual capacity, that of sympathy and pity towards living creatures like himself<figcaption>— Leo Tolstoy</figcaption></blockquote>
<blockquote>While we ourselves are the living graves of murdered beasts, how can we expect any ideal conditions on this earth?<figcaption>— George Bernard Shaw</figcaption></blockquote>
<blockquote>For as long as men massacre animals, they will kill each other<figcaption>— Pythagoras</figcaption></blockquote>
<blockquote>The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated<figcaption>— Mahatma Gandhi</figcaption></blockquote>
<blockquote>Until he extends the circle of his compassion to all living things, man will not himself find peace<figcaption>— Albert Schweitzer</figcaption></blockquote>
<p>The self-serving idea that humans are in a different moral sphere to other animals is a pre-Darwinian conception of ourselves which has both destructive and cruel consequences. Modern science shows that we are relatives in the same family tree, the vast majority of our biology predates modern humans. Our shared evolutionary nature means that much of the human emotional, intellectual and physical experience of existence is shared to some degree by other sentient life, especially those with higher levels of sentience. We who know what it is to suffer should extend our consideration to those who share that ability, appropriate to their sentience.</p>
<p>To look into the eyes of a dog, a cow, or a child is to see something of ourselves looking back into our eyes and wondering about us, experiencing this existence. Many animals share with us this magical spark of consciousness, to arbitrarily diminish or extinguish that spark because they do not share our specific identity is an injustice. Just as suffering is not unique to humans, neither should the expression of our compassion be.</p>
<p>We are all earthlings, here sharing this experience of existence together. The great power we hold collectively over the lives of the other species of this world means the moral choices we make should be deeply thought through. Ignoring the ramifications of our power just because other sentient creatures are another species leads inevitably to suffering and injustice. Trying to live an ethical life is difficult, it asks much of us, but Ii we make mistakes in our moral thinking, let us err on the side of compassion.</p>
