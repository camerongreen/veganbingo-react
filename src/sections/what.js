const short_answer = `This is a false dichotomy. Humans are complex beings who can and do care about more than one thing. Beyond this surveys consistently find people who are compassionate to animals are also more likely than others to care about human rights and the environment. It is unnecessary and unwise to ration our compassion because when we widen our circle of empathy, we also strengthen it. If you care about people, all the evidence says going vegan will only deepen that consideration.`;

<p>The premise of this statement is that there is a hierarchy of suffering, humans and everything else less worthy beneath. Apparently whilst a single human suffers, we shouldn't think about any other suffering, even that of many billions of non-humans whose suffering we are directly responsible for and can lessen simply by our dietary choices. No evidence is given as to why we have to ration our compassion, nor is likely to be given. The best social science shows that people who care about non-human animals have a circle of compassion that also embraces humans more fully.</p>


<p>Martin Luther King said, "Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere”. If we teach a child that causing pain to an innocent human is wrong, is that lesson made less compelling when we tell them it doesn’t apply to any other being capable of suffering? Teaching children hunting and fishing goes beyond this, we are actively teaching them to pleasure in suffering and death, do we think this makes them more or less likely to be kind to humans? We can teach children to care about many things, the environment, our friends and families, people in poverty and the animals we share our world with, without diminishing them. Indeed, there is much to be said for fostering moral consistency, as Aristotle said, our morals are like a muscle that gets stronger through consistent exercise.</p>


<p>A plant-based diet reduces the number of animals suffering in factory farms and slaughterhouses, but it also reverberates positively out into the world in many other ways. Livestock’s inconvenient long shadow is involved in almost every environmental problem from a local to global scale. The way we farm animals is one of the primary drivers of the destructive Anthropocene, contributing to air pollution, water contamination, land degradation, species extinction, deforestation, invasive species and of course climate change. The scale of this industry is almost unimaginable, covering over half the arable land of the earth. Only 3% of the current mass of land animals are wild creatures, with the other 97% being humans and their livestock. Two-thirds of the mass of all birds in the world are now farmed chickens. The many billions of livestock animals consume many times enough grain to provide for the remaining food-poor regions of the world. Almost all the communicable diseases that have plagued humanity throughout history have been a result of our contact with animals, from colds and flu, COVID, the black death, smallpox, ebola and AIDs. Add to this that the majority of antibiotics in the world is fed to healthy livestock threatens to undermine one of the greatest human health breakthroughs of all time.</p>


<p>There is so much to be said about the positive effects on humanity of progressing beyond eating animals. It is not about choosing one species over the other, it is about a reverence for our world and the collective experience of sentience. Switching to a more compassionate diet that can be at least as healthy as our current diet will also ensure the health of life on earth.</p>


<p>Many great thinkers have keenly perceived the moral connection between our treatment of humans and non-humans:</p>
<blockquote>Whilst there are slaughterhouses, there will still be battlefields<figcaption>- Tolstoy</figcaption></blockquote>
<blockquote>Until we stop harming all other living beings, we are still savages<figcaption>- Thomas Edison</figcaption></blockquote>
<blockquote>We can judge the heart of a man by his treatment of animals<figcaption>- Immanuel Kant</figcaption></blockquote>
<blockquote>If you have men who will exclude any of god's creatures from the shelter of compassion and pity, you will have men who will deal likewise with their fellow men<figcaption>- St Francis of Assisi</figcaption></blockquote>
<blockquote>By killing, man suppresses in himself, unnecessarily, the highest spiritual capacity, that of sympathy and pity towards living creatures like himself<figcaption>- Tolstoy</figcaption></blockquote>
<blockquote>While we ourselves are the living graves of murdered beasts, how can we expect any ideal conditions on this earth?<figcaption>- George Bernard Shaw</figcaption></blockquote>
<blockquote>For as long as men massacre animals, they will kill each other<figcaption>- Pythagoras</figcaption></blockquote>
<blockquote>The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated<figcaption>- Mahatma Gandhi</figcaption></blockquote>
<blockquote>Until he extends the circle of his compassion to all living things, man will not himself find peace<figcaption>- Albert Schweitzer</figcaption></blockquote>
<p>The self-serving idea that humans are in a different moral sphere to other animals is a self-serving, largely pre-Darwinian conception of ourselves which has both destructive and cruel consequences. Modern science shows that we are relatives in the same family tree, the vast majority of our biology predates modern human brain development. Our shared evolutionary nature means that much of our human emotional, intellectual and physical experience of existence is shared to some degree by other sentient life, exponentially more so with those that have high levels of sentience. However imperfectly, empathy gives us a window into the emotional world non-human animals experience, most importantly what it is like to suffer.</p>
<p>To look into the eyes of a dog, a cow, or a child is to see something of ourselves looking back at us, wondering about us. Many animals share with us deep parts of the magical spark of consciousness, to justify diminishing or extinguishing that spark because they do not share our identity is an injustice. We are all earthlings, sharing this experience of an existence we did not choose, together. The great power we hold collectively over the lives of the other species of this world means the moral choices we make should be deeply thought through. Ignoring the lives other beings lead before they arrive in our supermarkets bled out, dismembered and packaged has led to widespread suffering and injustice.</p>
<p>Trying to live an ethical life is difficult, it asks much of us, requiring changing habits and learning new ways, of thinking about things that perhaps it would be more convenient for us not to think about. Sometimes the separation from our old selves, however positive, can cause friction in our lives and among the people who would prefer we validate their mindset by staying in it with them. There is a higher realm of human thought though, one that calls to us beyond the small worlds of human interaction and selfish desire. We have seen tangible progress in recent centuries, our societies discarded some of the worst barbarities towards each other and even some towards animals. One of the most meaningful things we can do in life is joining our voice and power to this positive direction for our world. Our intellectual and moral progression is bound up in the liberation of the oppressed, especially those who we oppress.  Forward, humans and non-humans, together.</p>
